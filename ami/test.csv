Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?,sug,D,ES2004a,directive
Okay .,bck,A,ES2004a,feedback
"Obviously it displays less on the screen ,",inf,D,ES2004a,inform
Teletext has got that option as well .,inf,B,ES2004a,inform
it displays less on the screen,inf,D,ES2004a,inform

Okay .,und,B,ES2004a,feedback
Okay .,bck,D,ES2004a,feedback

Okay .,stl,C,ES2004b,
Maybe ,stl,C,ES2004b,
Yep .,ass,A,ES2004b,feedback
Yep there we go .,ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
"Okay this is uh the working design ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so .",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ?,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
and try and take some inspiration from that .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
because I'm dealing with the inside really .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one .",be.pos,C,ES2004b,
Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"and , you don't need to send very much information .",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue",sug,C,ES2004b,directive
because most of them are powered by triple A batteries,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
but those can be quite bulky,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .,sug,C,ES2004b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
"Could I can I interject to ask a question there ,",el.inf,D,ES2004b,
Mm-hmm .,inf,B,ES2004b,inform
Yeah sure .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
is that appropriate ?,el.inf,D,ES2004b,
You're saying the triple A batteries are small or the surrounding it ?,el.inf,D,ES2004b,
"Um no no ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"and that's because of the size of the batteries ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Right ,",bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
"the triple As are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?",el.inf,D,ES2004b,
Yeah,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
the the ,fra,C,ES2004b,
They are .,inf,B,ES2004b,inform
well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
Okay .,bck,A,ES2004b,feedback
Oh I see .,und,D,ES2004b,feedback
but I'm just wondering about power consumption,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
and how much you need to send the data across .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
"Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Um , now the ones at the moment are small",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .,sug,C,ES2004b,directive
Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"cause otherwise it's not gonna work ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later",sug,C,ES2004b,directive
and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the TV,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"It's not a proper circuit ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"I'm not sure if it'd work or not ,",ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
"I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway ,",ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh UI interface um,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of IR data which could be decoded by the TV receiver ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
because that's what all TVs use at the moment .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"And then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
so that that should be good .,ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
"Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
we were talking about it before,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"and also just something that I was thinking about , uh",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have ,",sug,C,ES2004b,directive
Mm .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
Mm .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
I th that was just sort of a general point there .,ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
Mm .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
And that's uh yeah .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"That's a very important part ,",ass,D,ES2004b,feedback
"it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Alright okay ,",ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
"and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,",inf,C,ES2004b,inform
so if you wanna ,sug,C,ES2004b,directive
"Okay , thank you very much .",be.pos,B,ES2004b,
"Um , would you like to continue on from that ?",el.sug,B,ES2004b,directive
Yep .,off,A,ES2004b,commissive

F function .,inf,B,ES2004b,inform
Function F eight yeah .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
Okay .,ass,A,ES2004b,feedback
Mm why's it in the right ?,el.inf,A,ES2004b,
No .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
"The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .",sug,D,ES2004b,directive
"Yeah , it's connecting .",ass,A,ES2004b,feedback
"No , no",ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
yeah it's just .,fra,C,ES2004b,
Meter adjusting .,oth,D,ES2004b,
okay .,fra,A,ES2004b,
"Oh , there .",fra,B,ES2004b,
"Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
"but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
"because um , I haven't had some marketing data",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
and basically every product is marketable .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
"So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
to make make it as simple as possible .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
"And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
"But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it ,",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
will this two features together .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The,sug,A,ES2004b,directive
main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top,sug,A,ES2004b,directive
"and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .",sug,A,ES2004b,directive
So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body,sug,A,ES2004b,directive
and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people .,sug,A,ES2004b,directive
Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
As we saw we we have to make a profit also,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production,sug,A,ES2004b,directive
mm by fifty million we said ?,el.inf,A,ES2004b,
Yeah .,inf,C,ES2004b,inform
"Yeah ,",ass,A,ES2004b,feedback
"with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also ,",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
"Um , that's so this is ",fra,A,ES2004b,
"if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design",inf,A,ES2004b,inform
and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard,sug,A,ES2004b,directive
because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .,inf,A,ES2004b,inform
Mm .,bck,D,ES2004b,feedback
"Uh any comments like , if you want ?",el.ass,A,ES2004b,

Look at that .,ass,B,ES2004b,feedback
"Okay , um ,",stl,D,ES2004b,
I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Um , so that's where we started ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"male and female ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
all age groups from fifteen upwards,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"and um we observed them in the lab ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"just their general use of the remote control ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
you can see we had a hundred subjects there .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Our findings , lots of findings ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
I've just summarised some of them here .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
so it has obvious design implications there .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"we were quite surprised by that finding ,",ass,D,ES2004b,feedback
"but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
Yeah .,bck,A,ES2004b,feedback
So again there's power implications there .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
so again a big design issue there .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um,sug,D,ES2004b,directive
"the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly .",sug,D,ES2004b,directive
"Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups .",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
"and in the older age group it kind of reverses ,",inf,D,ES2004b,inform
they're not so bothered with this .,inf,D,ES2004b,inform

um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um ,inf,B,ES2004b,inform
"our control is only going to be for TV ,",inf,B,ES2004b,inform
"it's not going to be a combined control ,",inf,B,ES2004b,inform

so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?,el.inf,D,ES2004b,

I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming .,inf,B,ES2004b,inform

Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?,el.inf,A,ES2004b,
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2004b,feedback
Um we didn't really look into that,inf,D,ES2004b,inform

Ten perc,fra,A,ES2004b,

Yeah .,bck,C,ES2004b,feedback
and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare ,inf,D,ES2004b,inform
Okay .,bck,A,ES2004b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,B,ES2004b,feedback
Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing,inf,C,ES2004b,inform

the minutes from the last time .,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
"Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything",inf,B,ES2004c,inform
um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
Um,stl,B,ES2004c,
"we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition ,",inf,B,ES2004c,inform
we've decided on there being a flip design,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
and um a different shape from what's normal .,inf,B,ES2004c,inform

We just connect up .,off,D,ES2004c,commissive
Thank you .,be.pos,D,ES2004c,
There we go .,ass,D,ES2004c,feedback
Okay um,stl,D,ES2004c,
so we decided on our market,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
and the the general feedback from them is that the most,fra,D,ES2004c,
im uh w I'm sorry,be.pos,D,ES2004c,
"I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
sorry Project Manager .,be.pos,D,ES2004c,
It's okay .,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
and we'll come to that later .,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
So that was one of the first things we did .,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . ",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative ,",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important ,",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative ,",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2004c,feedback
"Okay , um ,",stl,D,ES2004c,
"now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group ,",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?,sug,D,ES2004c,directive
"There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials ,",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
uh again in contrast to last year .,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"So a lot of interesting feedback there ,",ass,D,ES2004c,feedback
both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan .,ass,D,ES2004c,feedback
Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .,ass,D,ES2004c,feedback

Okay thank you very much . Um,be.pos,B,ES2004c,
Yep .,bck,A,ES2004c,feedback
let's start from the inside and work our way out .,sug,B,ES2004c,directive
Fine . It's okay with me .,ass,A,ES2004c,feedback

Okay .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
I hate those little things,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
I know .,ass,D,ES2004c,feedback
"Kay , ",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
Okay .,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
Okay .,stl,C,ES2004c,
Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"Okay , first uh the Into the method .",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Kay .,bck,B,ES2004c,feedback
"Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there .",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
This is uh the chip called the TA double one eight three five,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
and um it's pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the moment .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Kay .,bck,B,ES2004c,feedback
Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"There's um actually no rechargeable option available ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
so we ,stl,C,ES2004c,
I saw the um the standard double A and triple A,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment ,",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
"dynamo charging ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
Wa ,fra,B,ES2004c,
can you explain that ?,el.inf,B,ES2004c,
people won't ,fra,C,ES2004c,
it's it's basically like wind-up radio .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Like a ,fra,B,ES2004c,
"right , okay .",ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
So you wind up your remote control before you use it .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
How ,stl,B,ES2004c,
what kind of ,stl,B,ES2004c,
It might ,fra,C,ES2004c,
"how l long can you get out of that ,",el.inf,B,ES2004c,
I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or ,el.inf,B,ES2004c,
You ,fra,C,ES2004c,
"Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options ,",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
"like the the solar charging ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got TV .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
That doesn't count though does it ?,el.inf,B,ES2004c,
Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?,el.inf,D,ES2004c,
I thought it was UV like ,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
Artificial light ?,el.inf,D,ES2004c,
No .,fra,C,ES2004c,
Is it ?,el.inf,C,ES2004c,
Alright i,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
Has to be solar .,inf,D,ES2004c,inform
"Any , any ",el.ass,B,ES2004c,
Yep .,off,A,ES2004c,commissive
"Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light",el.inf,A,ES2004c,
"because we we have to take into consideration size also ,",inf,A,ES2004c,inform
so maybe a standard triple A might take lesser space or ,inf,A,ES2004c,inform
and dynamo might take more space .,inf,A,ES2004c,inform
Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
"Yeah , okay .",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
Mm .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
"Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights",inf,B,ES2004c,inform
"Artificial light , no .",ass,D,ES2004c,feedback
"no ,",ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market .,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
That's going to ,fra,D,ES2004c,
"I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .",inf,B,ES2004c,inform
"I know ,",ass,D,ES2004c,feedback
"different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
Uh ,fra,A,ES2004c,
But ,fra,C,ES2004c,
Yeah,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
and most people most people also watch TV in the in the night anyway .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Right .,bck,A,ES2004c,feedback
Night .,bck,A,ES2004c,feedback
"Mm , but then it would be charging through the day ,",ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
Okay .,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Yeah I've seen ,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
and you d you don't even notice it .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
And are these like uh ,stl,A,ES2004c,
"what are the life of the kinetic battery ,",el.inf,A,ES2004c,
it like it runs for long time ?,el.inf,A,ES2004c,
Um yeah,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
it's ,stl,C,ES2004c,
it charges into um some form of ,stl,C,ES2004c,
"it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2004c,feedback
cause they use them quite frequently in watches .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Okay .,bck,A,ES2004c,feedback
And that'll that would l would last for um,fra,C,ES2004c,
well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time",ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
We c,fra,A,ES2004c,
Yeah .,bck,C,ES2004c,feedback
"so you're walking around , you're doing things ,",inf,B,ES2004c,inform
it is moving a lot of the time,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
Yeah,bck,C,ES2004c,feedback
If you'd ,stl,B,ES2004c,
and ,fra,C,ES2004c,
"I mean you switch the TV on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .",inf,B,ES2004c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
Yeah but then again,fra,C,ES2004c,
Is it really gonna be enough ?,el.ass,B,ES2004c,
I I think it is,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
"because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Okay .,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
"And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Hmm .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
So it's not the draw on it isn't ,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
and you put it ,fra,C,ES2004c,
Mm-hmm . Mm .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be ,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,ES2004c,feedback
Could I just ask ,off,D,ES2004c,commissive
"referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?",el.inf,D,ES2004c,
Mm .,bck,C,ES2004c,feedback
"I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging",el.inf,D,ES2004c,
Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
or the two things not compatible ?,el.inf,D,ES2004c,
Like a dual kind of .,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
and they ,stl,C,ES2004c,
"because , if you lie ",stl,C,ES2004c,
on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Mm .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
So that affects the exterior design .,ass,D,ES2004c,feedback
Solar would be slightly expensives .,inf,A,ES2004c,inform
Expensive as well .,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
"They're they're expensive ,",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
What kind of price are we looking at for ,el.inf,B,ES2004c,
they don't ,fra,C,ES2004c,
I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?,inf,B,ES2004c,inform
It's twelve point f,fra,A,ES2004c,
Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
"I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
um but the ,stl,C,ES2004c,

if you if you have y,fra,C,ES2004c,
Well they're not designed ,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big,inf,C,ES2004c,inform

Y I think ,fra,C,ES2004c,
Practical-wise okay .,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback
"yeah , practically .",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot ,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"whereas remotes you do ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
they can t,fra,C,ES2004c,
You do get a bit of wear,ass,B,ES2004c,feedback

the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be,inf,C,ES2004c,inform

and,stl,C,ES2004c,
the the main problems with the ,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
well you could go for wood,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
but I think it would be a bit impractical .,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
"Titanium um very expensive just to process ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform

Mm .,bck,B,ES2004c,feedback
"and rubber ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Mm .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
"so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,",sug,C,ES2004c,directive
"but I was thinking more of the buttons ,",sug,C,ES2004c,directive
because the buttons which they've they've said,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2004c,feedback
and it's meant to be anti RSI .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,ES2004c,feedback
I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances,ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
but that's what they said .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
"If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform
whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform
But whether whether or not ,fra,C,ES2004c,
because we'd have it in two separate units,inf,C,ES2004c,inform

for the flip phone .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform

Yeah .,bck,C,ES2004c,feedback
you call it a skin or whatever .,inf,A,ES2004c,inform

Yeah I th,fra,C,ES2004c,

the ju just ,stl,C,ES2004c,
"it w well you could make it available in the titanium ,",inf,C,ES2004c,inform

Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2004c,feedback
it's light and strong,inf,C,ES2004c,inform

"Rubber , yeah .",ass,C,ES2004c,feedback
"that would give the spongy feel ,",inf,D,ES2004c,inform
that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .,inf,D,ES2004c,inform

you could have just a bare PCB circuit board,inf,C,ES2004c,inform

that would be one option .,inf,C,ES2004c,inform

Okay .,bck,B,ES2014a,feedback
There's one .,oth,B,ES2014a,
"We've had more time to prepare over this side ,",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . ,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Didn't think of that .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
Kay uh,bck,B,ES2014a,feedback
The three pens are underneath .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
pens are over here .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
I'll try the red pen .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
Okay . Um . ,stl,B,ES2014a,
I'm gonna go for the bear,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
"which I'm be able to draw very well ,",be.pos,B,ES2014a,
but I'll have a bash at it .,off,B,ES2014a,commissive
You get marks for artistic impression . ,be.pos,A,ES2014a,
Uh .,bck,B,ES2014a,feedback
Ooh ooh ,oth,B,ES2014a,
I lost it there .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
I think I've just knocked the microphone . Um .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
So you're just doing the face . ,be.pos,A,ES2014a,
We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
like the jungle book characters and stuff like that .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
Great . ,bck,B,ES2014a,feedback
Right .,stl,D,ES2014a,
Hello .,be.pos,D,ES2014a,
"Um I'm gonna go for the dog ,",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
and I'm gonna draw one badly as well .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
Uh .,stl,D,ES2014a,
looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something .,ass,D,ES2014a,feedback
That's quite good . ,ass,C,ES2014a,feedback
Right . There's my dog .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
Um I like dogs because they're very loyal .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
"And they're always happy ,",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
"so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited .",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
And they're also good for exercise as well .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
"And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . ",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
"Okay , that's why I like dogs .",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
"Right , um . ",stl,A,ES2014a,
Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
cause to be honest with you uh I'm not too keen on them anyway .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Not to worry .,oth,A,ES2014a,
So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Uh ,fra,A,ES2014a,
As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well .,ass,A,ES2014a,feedback
Anyway um . ,fra,A,ES2014a,
And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
"because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you .",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
"Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
"and uh change the water every couple of months ,",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
"and buy in a few plants , so .",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
"Other than the fact that they keep dying ,",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Great .,ass,D,ES2014a,feedback
Right .,stl,A,ES2014a,
"Okay ,",stl,A,ES2014a,
uh if we're still all with us .,be.pos,A,ES2014a,
"Right okay , so .",stl,A,ES2014a,
Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014a,feedback
That information has come from our marketing manager here . ,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014a,feedback
"So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe .",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
So um ,stl,A,ES2014a,
"Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote .",oth,A,ES2014a,
So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yes . ,ass,B,ES2014a,feedback
So uh any any thoughts ?,el.inf,A,ES2014a,
Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
so they're quite hard to press,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons .,sug,B,ES2014a,directive
As that is the main function .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
"Okay , so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yes .,ass,B,ES2014a,feedback
and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Um we're looking for a device that is uh ,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
What was the other things you said there ?,el.inf,A,ES2014a,
Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform
Easy to use .,oth,A,ES2014a,

is easy to use and see .,inf,B,ES2014a,inform

Okay .,ass,A,ES2014a,feedback
Uh .,stl,A,ES2014a,
Can I just check ?,off,C,ES2014a,commissive
Is this just a television remote ?,el.inf,C,ES2014a,
"Because a lot of um systems are kind of TV video combined now ,",inf,C,ES2014a,inform
or TV DVD combined .,inf,C,ES2014a,inform
And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house .,inf,C,ES2014a,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014a,feedback
"So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .",sug,C,ES2014a,directive
Mm .,bck,D,ES2014a,feedback
Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ?,el.inf,C,ES2014a,
Oh I w um,fra,A,ES2014a,
basically I'll get back to you on that .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
"But it seems to me sensible ,",ass,A,ES2014a,feedback
"cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room .",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014a,feedback
And uh ,fra,A,ES2014a,
So a device for for all remotes .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
I've,fra,D,ES2014a,
"Sorry ,",be.pos,B,ES2014a,
you go . You go .,el.sug,B,ES2014a,directive
Okay . Yeah .,off,D,ES2014a,commissive
Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
Cause there's quite often lots and lots .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
"So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel ,",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
So so I don't,fra,D,ES2014a,
we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room .,sug,D,ES2014a,directive
Comes to your whistle . ,sug,C,ES2014a,directive
Hmm . ,ass,A,ES2014a,feedback
"That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but ",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
Yeah . ,bck,B,ES2014a,feedback
But is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to ,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014a,feedback
"cause you want you want simplicity as well ,",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
you want any idiot to be able to use it .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014a,feedback
"Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014a,feedback
And so these are probably mutually exclusive options,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yes .,bck,B,ES2014a,feedback
that uh ,fra,A,ES2014a,
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014a,feedback
Hmm,stl,A,ES2014a,
"you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes ,",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
"therefore they're more with handling them ,",inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014a,feedback
therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote .,sug,B,ES2014a,directive
"Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself ,",el.inf,B,ES2014a,
or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?,el.inf,B,ES2014a,
Better instructions .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014a,feedback
"I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are ,",inf,D,ES2014a,inform
and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops .,inf,D,ES2014a,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014a,feedback

I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for .,und,C,ES2014a,feedback
Is this a mun multi-functional one,el.inf,C,ES2014a,
or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ?,el.inf,C,ES2014a,
"I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control ,",inf,B,ES2014a,inform
Television remote control .,oth,A,ES2014a,

Right .,ass,C,ES2014a,feedback
"That's true ,",ass,A,ES2014a,feedback
cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going .,inf,A,ES2014a,inform

That's good .,ass,B,ES2014b,feedback
"Okay , um ",stl,B,ES2014b,
Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um of the of the remote control .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"Um I've just got three sections ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
and how it connects with the television .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um the basic components are an energy source,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Okay .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
"Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"but is not actually part of the remote itself ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
because that's obviously found in the television .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
so . I'll just go through there .,off,B,ES2014b,commissive
"S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ?",el.inf,B,ES2014b,
Oh I'll j,fra,B,ES2014b,
I think it's that little ,inf,C,ES2014b,inform

I'll get rid of the bear,off,B,ES2014b,commissive
it's magic . ,be.pos,A,ES2014b,
Okay that's great .,ass,B,ES2014b,feedback
"Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"Uh no ,",ass,B,ES2014b,feedback
a power supply,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
which we'd probably get ,fra,B,ES2014b,
it's probably gonna be the battery .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um,stl,B,ES2014b,
"we then have a particular button ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
which may be ,fra,B,ES2014b,
that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um but this is how the basic system works .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um that sends ,fra,B,ES2014b,
"after you press that that sends the message to the chip ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
which um then sends ,fra,B,ES2014b,
It sort of interprets which button you've pressed,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . ,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um .,stl,B,ES2014b,
"So that's . That's the remote in itself ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
that's the components of the remote,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
and how they work together .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
So this is the uh user interface .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"Um this is the chip itself ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform

"So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? .",el.inf,A,ES2014b,
"Ah yes , that's the power source .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Um .,stl,B,ES2014b,
"going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
just because of the size .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"Um and then the sender ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
and infra-red um has been used quite successfully .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
You don't have to be point directly at the television itself .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
So the battery is the in the sender .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Um ,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Yes .,ass,B,ES2014b,feedback
Kay and that's it for the moment .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Okay .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
"So , now more design . ",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Right .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
Thank you .,be.pos,C,ES2014b,
Mine's not quite as complicated as all that .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
That's what we like to hear . ,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
Did I press function ?,el.inf,C,ES2014b,
Yeah .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Is it control function,el.inf,A,ES2014b,
Oh .,oth,C,ES2014b,
"ei Oh , th there you go .",ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Um here are two example remotes .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Um whereas the right remote is much simpler ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
it looks much more user friendly .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Um so my personal preference would be the right remote .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"So , it's got nice big buttons ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
it's got a very limited number of buttons .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Um they're nice ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
kinda clearly labelled .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"So it's very very user friendly ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
and it's got a little splash of colour .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Could maybe do with some more colour .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
Um .,fra,C,ES2014b,
Well there's a couple of things there .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
Do we get to see that ?,el.inf,C,ES2014b,
"I haven't as yet , no .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Will you be presenting that in a bit ? ,el.inf,C,ES2014b,
But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
So uh I'm guessing that uh uh,fra,A,ES2014b,
I notice on the bottom there it's got uh,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
what's that ?,el.inf,A,ES2014b,
APOGEE,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"that might be the corporate colour scheme ,",sug,A,ES2014b,directive
although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
"Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section ,",el.inf,B,ES2014b,
because that seems to be for a video as well .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
So we could dispense with that little bit as well,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
What do you mean by the circular section ?,el.inf,C,ES2014b,
Possibly ?,el.ass,B,ES2014b,
Like all of that bottom bit ?,el.inf,C,ES2014b,
J yeah yeah yeah j yeah,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
just this little bit,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
is that ,fra,B,ES2014b,
"I think that's still um a video remote part ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
so maybe we could get rid of that as well .,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
And I don't really think that you need nine numbers .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Well b uh w,fra,A,ES2014b,
"I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ?",el.inf,C,ES2014b,
I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .,sug,C,ES2014b,directive
Well th the on the ,fra,A,ES2014b,
Like how often do you hit nine ?,el.inf,C,ES2014b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"It's just people are used to seeing that ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
But but ,fra,A,ES2014b,
so if we didn't have them then they might think it's ,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"But ,",fra,A,ES2014b,
well possibly,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
"but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ?,el.inf,A,ES2014b,
I would have thought that uh it's forever expanding,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the BBC have come up with a further six",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
"So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather ",fra,A,ES2014b,
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
"Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
but presumably it'll take a second,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
cause you have to be able to stop it .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels,sug,A,ES2014b,directive
that w,fra,A,ES2014b,
and then you could dispense with more otherwise .,sug,A,ES2014b,directive
Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Um some remotes have kind of favourite options,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
"Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty",sug,A,ES2014b,directive
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want,sug,A,ES2014b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
and that would cut down your time .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm . Um .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
Anyway .,oth,A,ES2014b,
"But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers ,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Okay , yeah .",und,B,ES2014b,feedback
Whatever .,oth,A,ES2014b,
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
Okay . Okay .,stl,A,ES2014b,
"Limit the number of buttons ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
user friendly .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
But I suppose nine's not really excessive .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
I suppose it does make a good pattern .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with ,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
"Well that's true , yeah ,",ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
"you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
that that makes sense .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
Um .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Does .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Okay .,und,C,ES2014b,feedback
So w so what was the circular thing that you were ,el.inf,A,ES2014b,
"Um I think that's just for a video ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
so we wouldn't need any of that at all .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
So we could get it down to what ?,el.inf,B,ES2014b,
"If it's just for TV , which is what it is at the moment .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
So we get to ,fra,B,ES2014b,
How many buttons have we got ?,el.inf,B,ES2014b,
"We've just got ten , eleven twelve th",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
We got fourteen that we need . I guess .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Um which isn't really too many .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
Well we've we've got um that it's remote for TV only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform

"I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing ,",el.inf,A,ES2014b,

"but not from the company , no .",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
Right .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
"Right , okay ,",stl,A,ES2014b,
"so basically time to market seems to be important ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
therefore speed of delivery .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Kay .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
We've only got about another four hours left . ,inf,A,ES2014b,inform

Right well that's the end of my presentation .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Kay .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
I'm gonna pull this off .,off,D,ES2014b,commissive
I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up .,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
"Yeah ,",ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
I think she said twenty seconds to um ,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Uh-huh .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
I'm sure we'll have by the end of today .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
I'll give it another go .,off,D,ES2014b,commissive
"Yeah , there we go . ",ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
"Right ,",stl,D,ES2014b,
we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the TV,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
and um how do people use it ?,el.inf,D,ES2014b,
We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
and what improvements would would they like to remote control .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all .",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"And young people were quite receptive to this ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition .",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . ",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Okay , so ",stl,D,ES2014b,
My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech ,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"A design which looks high-tech , basically .",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an LCD menu for other functions on the remote control .",sug,D,ES2014b,directive
That's worth thinking about .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well ,",sug,D,ES2014b,directive
because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
That that might be the market that we're we're looking for .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels .",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
Mm .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
"Okay um ,",stl,D,ES2014b,
and that's the end of the slide show .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
That's it .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
Cool .,be.pos,D,ES2014b,
Do a lot of um ,fra,C,ES2014b,
What was that last wee bit there ?,el.inf,A,ES2014b,
Um about speech recognition ?,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Speech recognition ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
"But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .",el.inf,A,ES2014b,
Youn young people pref,el.inf,D,ES2014b,
"Yeah ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah . Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
Well that's right .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have,fra,B,ES2014b,
"You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two .,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
So you can press a button which is always kept in one place,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Uh-huh .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but ",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"That is true , yes .",ass,B,ES2014b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
"There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"I can't remember ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
"and then they whistle back , or something like that .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Sounds reasonable .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"That'd probably be really simple ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
they're cheap .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah . So ,fra,A,ES2014b,
So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the ,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
"Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .",sug,A,ES2014b,directive
But if you ,fra,A,ES2014b,
I know .,fra,A,ES2014b,
"Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
You'd want to try and av just have the one product,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
that if ,fra,A,ES2014b,
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
Um I dunno um talking about vo,fra,A,ES2014b,
I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
because it'll recognise the voice,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"and you can give it a command ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
a set command whatever that happened to be .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then ,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
you could have an option to turn it off . Or ,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"Perhaps , um .",sug,B,ES2014b,directive
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
So that would solve the problems with the TV kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Mm .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
So uh ,stl,A,ES2014b,
Any sugges,fra,A,ES2014b,
"Well , any conclusions ?",el.inf,A,ES2014b,
Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?,el.inf,D,ES2014b,
Mm .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Considering ,fra,D,ES2014b,
Well if it does then we can't .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"It's that simple ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
We've got um the remote was only for the television,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and not for ,fra,A,ES2014b,
because that would make it too complex,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and we have to get it market quickly .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
So that means that uh ,fra,A,ES2014b,
Kay .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
So we're being focused effectively directly at a television,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yes .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
"So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Has to be simple enough to ,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
because time to market is is critical . S,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
It would .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Kay .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
"Added extras would be nice ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
which effectively now is sort of four hours .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
So and if ,fra,A,ES2014b,
and we've gotta get to the end .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Okay .,stl,A,ES2014b,
So ,stl,D,ES2014b,
"Right okay , uh so I need to ",stl,A,ES2014b,
Right . So,stl,A,ES2014b,
I don't know how long we have left of our uh time .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
About five minutes .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yes .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Um . ,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
We'll also know w when the next meeting is,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
And then we can report back at the next meeting,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Does that make reasonable sense ?,el.und,A,ES2014b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Yes that seems right .,und,B,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,und,C,ES2014b,feedback
"Okay , yeah .",und,D,ES2014b,feedback
So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .",sug,A,ES2014b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Do it via the email,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Okay . Yep .,und,D,ES2014b,feedback
so that rather than coming you know ,fra,A,ES2014b,
If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"Come along with it in the next meeting ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
we can discuss it then,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and take whatever action is appropriate .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Okay .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
"But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know",inf,A,ES2014b,inform

Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
Okay .,stl,A,ES2014b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"Right , is there ",fra,A,ES2014b,
So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S,el.inf,D,ES2014b,
I would guess so .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
and ,fra,D,ES2014b,
Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform

Yep .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback

I don't really know about the voice recognition thing .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
I w well uh i,fra,A,ES2014b,
"Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment ,",sug,B,ES2014b,directive
Something simple .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
and if something comes back ,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
"Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
something that's quick and simple .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014b,feedback
"So ,",stl,A,ES2014b,
"And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
sounds good .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
"cause everyone can whistle or clap ,",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be ",sug,A,ES2014b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
now something that doesn't like whis uh,fra,A,ES2014b,
"No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? ",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
Well I I I don't know .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
"Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
but if ,fra,A,ES2014b,

Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
"Taking out teletext , okay .",und,D,ES2014b,feedback
so so take out teletext .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers,el.inf,B,ES2014b,
Right .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .,el.inf,B,ES2014b,

so zero to nine .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Mm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
"I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
so you can press any two,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
and it'll sort of put them together .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Okay , ten numbers",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
and then some kind of device to allow uh ,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
Or multiple digits .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
Did we decide anything about um the other functions ?,el.inf,B,ES2014b,
As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ?,el.inf,B,ES2014b,
You had an had an idea about the menu ?,el.inf,B,ES2014b,

But just thinking um people probably ,fra,B,ES2014b,
I mean you don't have ,fra,B,ES2014b,
"you only have to probably tune in the TV once ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform

"So and if finally the TV breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it .",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
You can't really avoid that .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
No .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback
Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
So that'll be in ,fra,B,ES2014b,
But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
Yes .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
"and if it is at the moment , that's fine .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"But at the moment it's not ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform

Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah yeah .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback

which is ,fra,A,ES2014b,
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback

"the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale ,",inf,A,ES2014b,inform

"I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions ,",inf,D,ES2014b,inform
That's right .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . ,sug,D,ES2014b,directive
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
So how would this menu function work ?,el.inf,B,ES2014b,

"Yeah ,",ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
"Yeah ,",ass,C,ES2014b,feedback

like the volume or something .,sug,C,ES2014b,directive
Okay .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback

we're gonna have the the individual numbers,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
and then a menu function,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
"and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide ",inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Presu uh,fra,B,ES2014b,
I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work .,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
Uh ,stl,D,ES2014b,
I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .,inf,D,ES2014b,inform
"Right , okay um .",und,B,ES2014b,feedback
"So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it ,",sug,D,ES2014b,directive
so you're basically pressing ,fra,D,ES2014b,
"that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two ,",inf,B,ES2014b,inform

Mm .,bck,A,ES2014b,feedback

you don't have to see it all the time .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform

Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Yeah . Yeah .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
"Oh no , I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the TV remote .",inf,C,ES2014b,inform
"Oh , okay .",und,B,ES2014b,feedback
Right .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback

I've never used them .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Um .,bck,B,ES2014b,feedback
I just know they're something to do with Dolby .,inf,C,ES2014b,inform
Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think ,inf,B,ES2014b,inform
Well you might get some research . ,be.pos,A,ES2014b,
Well shall we look into that and just get back together .,sug,B,ES2014b,directive
Okay .,ass,A,ES2014b,feedback
Okay .,ass,D,ES2014b,feedback
Right .,bck,C,ES2014b,feedback
Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting .,off,A,ES2014b,commissive
Right .,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
And we'll meet back at I'm not sure .,inf,A,ES2014b,inform
"Um forty minutes , I believe is the time .",inf,A,ES2014b,inform

Okay . ,bck,D,ES2014b,feedback
Come on .,oth,A,ES2014b,
Okay .,stl,A,ES2014c,
Right .,stl,A,ES2014c,
Conceptual design meeting .,oth,A,ES2014c,
"Right . Okay , so ",stl,A,ES2014c,
"Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"but uh it didn't work out too well ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had .",off,A,ES2014c,commissive
"Uh right , so ",stl,A,ES2014c,
Wishing I hadn't closed the damn ,oth,A,ES2014c,
Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"We're gonna have uh effectively two pages ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
only as and when required .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
So .,stl,A,ES2014c,
So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Uh have there been any uh changes ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
"I think we all have a presentation again ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
so if we go through those and then um,sug,B,ES2014c,directive
Right .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Three presentation , yeah .",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Shall I go first again ? ,off,B,ES2014c,commissive
So ,stl,A,ES2014c,
"Yeah , fine .",ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
I see this a little more smoothly than the last one .,off,B,ES2014c,commissive
"Okay right , let's get started . Um",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
basically the uh for the ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Um I'll back actually .,oth,B,ES2014c,
"For the components design , um next step is",fra,B,ES2014c,
basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Then there is a chip,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
and still the sender .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
So um yes including the power s supply as well .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
um . ,stl,B,ES2014c,
There's a dynamo .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up ,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
um .,fra,B,ES2014c,
"There's a kinetic option ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Um that's one option ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
but I think that was gonna cost a little more .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
which is ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
which I guess is just the same as the standard ones .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
which may be for the volume .,sug,B,ES2014c,directive
You could do do that .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
so we have to take that into consideration .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Um moving on to the printed s,fra,B,ES2014c,
What would be the cost do do we know ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Um that's on the next ,fra,B,ES2014c,
"I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
but it does affect the printed circuit board .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Um which is the next section .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
"The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
And there's different prices according to each .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
so there is an extra price in that sense .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
um which is the idea of the watches um that you move,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
you move the remote around to power it up .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
And that's it .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Kay .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
with the printed circuit boards you were going for the ,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Thanks . ,be.pos,C,ES2014c,
Um i it kind of depends um,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,und,A,ES2014c,feedback
"Uh but I don't know ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
so that is something I'll have to look into .,off,B,ES2014c,commissive
But are we going f R,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
right .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue ,",sug,A,ES2014c,directive
Yeah yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
We decide . Yeah .,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
so would it not be best to ,fra,A,ES2014c,
rather than ,fra,A,ES2014c,
I mean one way is to do each of the presentations,sug,A,ES2014c,directive
and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were .,sug,A,ES2014c,directive
The other way would be to do the presentation,sug,A,ES2014c,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
and then make the decision at that point in time .,sug,A,ES2014c,directive
Um . Maybe w,fra,B,ES2014c,
"Yeah ,",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
"that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
"Cause at that point then you've got the details up there ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Um .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
and then that would be the end of that issue .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Does that make sense ?,el.und,A,ES2014c,
Yes .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
Um I have a lot of the information there .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
It might not be very clear .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Is there ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Unless you want to plug it back in to yours .,sug,C,ES2014c,directive
Um .,stl,B,ES2014c,
"We could do , yeah .",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
Um yeah we should .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
it didn't ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
No,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
"the scroll wheel required the regular ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
so the ,fra,A,ES2014c,
Yeah,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
"if if you down um . It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
"but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
which is in the higher price range .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,stl,A,ES2014c,
I think the scroll wheel um ,fra,C,ES2014c,
The display requires an advanced chip,oth,A,ES2014c,
the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .,oth,A,ES2014c,
Also the display's for something else which we decided against .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Um but that bit ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Okay .,und,A,ES2014c,feedback
"And note that the push button just requires a simple chip ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
so that would keep the price down .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Down .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ?",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
I I've got um pictures,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
and they don't really look great .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Right . Okay .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Kay .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
"So maybe just a simple push button ,",sug,B,ES2014c,directive
and that would cut costs on the ,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
So . So we're going for p Okay .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
So is um ,fra,A,ES2014c,
"So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ?",el.inf,D,ES2014c,
"Yeah , a simple pushbuttons .",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Simple push button . ,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ?,el.inf,B,ES2014c,
The um,fra,B,ES2014c,
"it was basically what we said before ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"the idea that you record in a set message ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
and then it picks up that message um and replies to you .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
So it is basically the concept we discussed before .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"I'm guessing it would ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
but got like the definite information .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than ,sug,B,ES2014c,directive
"So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ?",el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Or are we going for the regular ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-mm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
But is there any other ,fra,A,ES2014c,
"I mean okay , that's true for the for for that element ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
but we have to take all el elements into consideration .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Mm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
"I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision .",sug,D,ES2014c,directive
But ,fra,C,ES2014c,
"But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Right .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
it just ,fra,C,ES2014c,
it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah .",ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
"So maybe that would be something separate , yeah .",sug,B,ES2014c,directive
So I don't think it would effect our circuit board .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
No .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
"Okay ,",und,B,ES2014c,feedback
so we'd have a simple circuit board,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Oh that makes sense .,und,B,ES2014c,feedback
"Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo .",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Mm-mm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
"It might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo .",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah . ,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ?,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Yeah that makes sense ,",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
so we'd stick with the simple circuit board,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Yeah ,",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
just as a fun way to find it .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform

Okay .,stl,A,ES2014c,
W w kinetic .,oth,A,ES2014c,

I think it said the cost of that isn't too much .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .,el.ass,A,ES2014c,
Um yeah,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Um .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
And how does it get uh charged up ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Okay .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
and then that powers it up to use it .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,stl,A,ES2014c,
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
So the speech recognition was ,fra,A,ES2014c,
Are we going for speech recognition ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
No ?,el.ass,A,ES2014c,
Cause that required the advanced ,sug,A,ES2014c,directive

but I don't think it'd um ,fra,C,ES2014c,

Just just for the call and find thing .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform

Um I think I might have got that wrong .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Oh .,und,A,ES2014c,feedback
"Cause it's s it's separate isn't it ,",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
So okay .,stl,A,ES2014c,
it's not part of the ,fra,D,ES2014c,
Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
It's it's just an addition thing,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
it's um,fra,B,ES2014c,
yeah .,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
And so we would want it in as an extra,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
because it doesn't appear to cost too much .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Would that be ,el.ass,A,ES2014c,

Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"I assume it would cost extra ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .,sug,B,ES2014c,directive

Um so that's a bit of competition there .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
So,stl,C,ES2014c,
I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing,sug,C,ES2014c,directive
and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control,sug,C,ES2014c,directive
"Yeah , yeah .",bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
rather than trying to compete with the functions .,sug,C,ES2014c,directive
"Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
but they don't look as sleek as other models .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
And there's no real advantage,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"On the price , yeah .",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
So you were saying the scroll buttons ,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Um ,fra,C,ES2014c,
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
"Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um .",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"There was children's remote ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
where um they just had a very limited range of buttons,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
and they were b uh bright and colourful,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Kay .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Um but I don't know if that's really in our field ?,el.ass,C,ES2014c,
But that's something that's out there .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , maybe not ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?,el.inf,B,ES2014c,
Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude ,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
and then you could have additional features,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
in you know like a ,fra,A,ES2014c,
"You'd have model one , model two and model three ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
and therefore you can sub-divide your market up .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
But that's really where your field is .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step ,",sug,B,ES2014c,directive
"but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should ",fra,B,ES2014c,
"Anyway you could add on for an extra package ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Okay .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
Right well that's something that we can be aware of .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Is that,fra,A,ES2014c,
So so what are we deciding to do here ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Um .,stl,C,ES2014c,
"I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function .",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Right .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
Uh the fi,fra,A,ES2014c,
"Yeah ,",ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,und,A,ES2014c,feedback
Oh yeah .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
S s so um ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Different languages might not be compatible .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"Yeah , yeah .",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
"It w it would make it quite complicated ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
and then the ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Yeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"Yeah , yeah .",bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
"Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device ,",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it .,ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
Maybe,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
And you were talking,fra,A,ES2014c,
unless something else comes up .,el.inf,C,ES2014c,
Mm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
And you were talking about scroll buttons ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Um yeah,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
and give no real kinda extra benefit,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
b,fra,A,ES2014c,
and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
was that right ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Yes yes .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Hmm um,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Okay . So not to be focused on .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Um just to avoid ambiguity .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V on for volume , ",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Um let's think how they did this .,off,C,ES2014c,commissive
Good in in ,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
I'm just gonna check so I do this right .,off,C,ES2014c,commissive
Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
An upside-down V .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Um . What did they say ?,oth,C,ES2014c,
"So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
and that's the first thing that they see ,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"Actually that can't be right , can it ?",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
Right .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
"Oh well , no ,",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
"they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
"whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
"So , be careful what you put on the buttons",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
So maybe we could have like ,fra,B,ES2014c,
"and be careful of the shape that you make them ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Yeah I I know what you mean .,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
So maybe we could have volume written on the side,sug,B,ES2014c,directive
and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
You could have volume up and volume ,fra,A,ES2014c,
Possible .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
"Volume up , down and Like that .",sug,A,ES2014c,directive
Mm .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
And 'cause the idea was to have limited um ,fra,A,ES2014c,
it was to have sizable amount of information on it .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
Limited number of buttons .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
"Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were ",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
we got it down to not too many .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Um and I think that's all I had to say for that .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ?,el.inf,C,ES2014c,
Um ,fra,B,ES2014c,
"Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment ,",el.inf,B,ES2014c,
or are we gonna t,fra,B,ES2014c,
I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"Yeah , maybe we should see yours first .",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
Oh okay .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
Okay .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Cool .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"the the one that's the one I talked about last time ,",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used .",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
You know yourself . ,be.pos,A,ES2014c,
So ,fra,D,ES2014c,
So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
Kay .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
"And second , there should be some technological innovation .",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well .",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"And apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy ,",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"which is contrary to last year , apparently .",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
I presume it must have been not not spongy last year .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
So,stl,D,ES2014c,
we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
And then also try and add in technological informat innovation,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap .,sug,D,ES2014c,directive
"And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority ,",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed .,sug,D,ES2014c,directive
And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg ,",sug,D,ES2014c,directive
"or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow .",sug,D,ES2014c,directive
Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic .,sug,D,ES2014c,directive
"And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote ,",sug,D,ES2014c,directive
say in the shape of a banana or something like that . ,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
"Right , so that'll be it .",inf,D,ES2014c,inform
Maybe a banana or courgette or something . ,sug,D,ES2014c,directive
"How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends ,",el.inf,D,ES2014c,
"do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget ,",el.inf,D,ES2014c,
"or or you know , do they not matter that much ?",el.inf,D,ES2014c,
"I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
"Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
cause you're can mis-direct people .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"And I would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so .",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
"Maybe just one button ,",sug,C,ES2014c,directive
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Maybe that could be a little apple .,sug,C,ES2014c,directive
Maybe yeah . ,ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
"And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Okay . Now ? Yeah .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
and it wouldn't confuse the numbers .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Stand-by button .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
No,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
"th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Well I dunno,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
"I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
But what are they gonna be next ,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
Yeah .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
What are they gonna be next year . ,el.inf,A,ES2014c,
maybe ,fra,B,ES2014c,
Yeah yeah . ,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Hmm . S,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr,fra,A,ES2014c,
"If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Yeah ,",ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
I'm not ,fra,D,ES2014c,
"That means you're constantly changing your production schedule ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
"and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform
I don't know .,oth,D,ES2014c,
I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"Yeah , yeah . ",ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
to something which is maybe more universal .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Well ,fra,A,ES2014c,
"But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design ,",sug,C,ES2014c,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"um even if the design kind of changes , ",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .,sug,B,ES2014c,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Ah d d But if ,fra,A,ES2014c,
"Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um .",sug,B,ES2014c,directive
Mm-hmm .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Well . Yep .,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
Maybe still with a rubber design we could ,sug,B,ES2014c,directive
Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ?,el.inf,A,ES2014c,

Yeah .,inf,D,ES2014c,inform

Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
Um .,fra,B,ES2014c,
And that you can make them curved or double-curved,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look .,inf,C,ES2014c,inform
Oh yeah yeah,oth,B,ES2014c,
one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
"Oh right ,",und,C,ES2014c,feedback
Um oh no no no,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
"that fits , doesn't it ?",ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
sorry,be.pos,B,ES2014c,
it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
That's the way round .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Which makes sense .,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
Right .,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
Um .,fra,B,ES2014c,
Rubber buttons require rubber case . ,oth,A,ES2014c,

Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Uh so , yeah .",fra,A,ES2014c,
The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ?,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay ,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
you want to basically mint them out,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
"You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that ,",sug,A,ES2014c,directive
and especially 'cause then you could make it something that ,fra,A,ES2014c,
I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual ,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"Well , you might be limited in space , that yes .",ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
would or not .,fra,B,ES2014c,
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,ES2014c,feedback
Yes yes .,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions,sug,B,ES2014c,directive
like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
"But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production ,",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
"whether that would just increase the costs ,",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
Hmm .,bck,A,ES2014c,feedback
make it more complicated .,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
That's possibly it .,ass,D,ES2014c,feedback
So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing .,inf,A,ES2014c,inform
Yeah,ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
"the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform

"and the general function of the remote would stay the same ,",inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014c,feedback
but you could change the the way it looked .,inf,B,ES2014c,inform
Yeah,ass,C,ES2014c,feedback
and then you could have ,fra,C,ES2014c,
"Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,",inf,C,ES2014c,inform
"Yeah , that's true .",ass,B,ES2014c,feedback
but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .,sug,C,ES2014c,directive
Yeah,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback
"you you could do a colour change ,",inf,A,ES2014c,inform
so therefore you would,fra,A,ES2014c,
yeah yeah ,ass,A,ES2014c,feedback

Could we get this on the board just so we can see ,sug,B,ES2014d,directive
or do you mean do you have the figures there ?,el.inf,B,ES2014d,
we should plug it in .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Right .,bck,A,ES2014d,feedback
Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one .,sug,D,ES2014d,directive

Right .,bck,A,ES2014d,feedback
Kay this should be then .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
"Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform

Mm-hmm .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
Have a push button interface .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
Okay . W the button supplements .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Um ,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
"Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Um ,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
But ,fra,A,ES2014d,
So the so the real w the real question then would come in .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Do you make all the buttons ,el.inf,A,ES2014d,
"Well do we'll do it on the prototype ,",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
O,fra,A,ES2014d,
"so do two ,",sug,D,ES2014d,directive
see how much it is .,sug,D,ES2014d,directive
"Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Everything else is gonna be a standard .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
And then we'd have ,fra,B,ES2014d,
"We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special ,",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"but according to this , maybe it is .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
So ,stl,A,ES2014d,
And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"I think you just do one , don't you , for the ",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"W I don't know is is is the sort of answer ,",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"is that meant to be all sixteen buttons ,",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"and therefore I mean , what's the op",fra,A,ES2014d,
"The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons ,",sug,A,ES2014d,directive
"but just to have the one that was soft and spongy ,",sug,A,ES2014d,directive
and therefore ,fra,A,ES2014d,
I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else ,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the ,inf,A,ES2014d,inform

I don't know though .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
I would ,fra,A,ES2014d,

um ,fra,A,ES2014d,
"Okay , um ,",stl,A,ES2014d,
"if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
We'd have one special colour,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
and one special button form .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
And if ,fra,A,ES2014d,
What happened ?,el.inf,A,ES2014d,
You've just gone off the window into another one .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
It's on the bottom row .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box .,sug,C,ES2014d,directive
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014d,feedback
"Now , right . ",stl,A,ES2014d,

Yeah . Yeah .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Okay .,ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
So that's nine point one there,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
so we've got some ,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
So it ,fra,A,ES2014d,
"Well , is it s is ",fra,A,ES2014d,
"no ,",ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
it's nine point seven I've got .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Kay .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
Okay .,el.und,A,ES2014d,
Just give us a bit of ,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
"So , that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
S,fra,C,ES2014d,
I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform

Uh-huh .,bck,A,ES2014d,feedback
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014d,feedback
We should be slightly over our budget,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
"but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech ",sug,B,ES2014d,directive
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"Well , hold on .",sug,A,ES2014d,directive
"Um , if we",fra,A,ES2014d,
"Okay , that gives us twelve point seven",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition",sug,B,ES2014d,directive
But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the ,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
without ,fra,B,ES2014d,
"Oh , I see ,",und,A,ES2014d,feedback
so just take out the special colour for the apple and ,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"Yeah , yeah .",ass,B,ES2014d,feedback
Um . D,fra,C,ES2014d,
wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ?,sug,C,ES2014d,directive
"You know how you turn that one to a zero ,",inf,C,ES2014d,inform
"wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,",sug,C,ES2014d,directive
"Yeah ,",ass,D,ES2014d,feedback
we have to have it ,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe .",ass,B,ES2014d,feedback
so you need both of them ?,sug,C,ES2014d,directive
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic .,sug,B,ES2014d,directive
Um ,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
And go for battery instead .,sug,A,ES2014d,directive
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
That would give you one less .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
We should ,fra,B,ES2014d,
"Yeah ,",ass,B,ES2014d,feedback
"that would save us one ,",inf,B,ES2014d,inform
though we'd still be slightly ov,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
But you reckon that,fra,A,ES2014d,
i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"Yeah , yeah .",ass,B,ES2014d,feedback
"Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them .",inf,B,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"Um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have .",inf,B,ES2014d,inform
"And then still have the batteries ,",inf,B,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
or whatever they would prefer not uh ,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
You know what I mean ?,el.und,B,ES2014d,
The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ?,el.inf,A,ES2014d,
I think the voice recognition .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
"In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
At least .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Remember that was a minimum requirement .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first ,",sug,D,ES2014d,directive
Yeah .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?,sug,D,ES2014d,directive
Mm-hmm . Makes sense .,ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
"Okay . Right um ,",stl,D,ES2014d,
Okay,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
I have a little thing .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"Sorry ,",be.pos,A,ES2014d,
do you want that back up ?,el.inf,A,ES2014d,
"Yeah ,",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
I just had a presentation to do . ,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Right .,ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
"Okay ,",ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm . Mm . ,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"Right okay um ,",stl,D,ES2014d,
This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype ,",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research ,",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"and also finance , I guess .",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven ,",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four .",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end .",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy .",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Whether it's easy to use .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
"And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Okay .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
so I'll go over here . ,off,D,ES2014d,commissive
Right .,stl,D,ES2014d,
"So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy .",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
So if we do a sort of a one ,off,D,ES2014d,commissive
So ,stl,D,ES2014d,
"Okay , well we have a single curve ,",inf,B,ES2014d,inform
which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good .,ass,B,ES2014d,feedback
Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014d,feedback
So uh ,fra,B,ES2014d,
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .",inf,B,ES2014d,inform
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .,ass,D,ES2014d,feedback
"Um , sorry that'd be considered fancy .",fra,B,ES2014d,
"Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two .",ass,C,ES2014d,feedback
Of but I think ,fra,D,ES2014d,
"What Is one false , or is t one true ?",el.inf,D,ES2014d,
I forgot .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
One's true .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
"One's true , and okay . Seven's fal",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
And a four is neutral .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
"Four is neutral , okay .",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
So ,stl,D,ES2014d,
So maybe maybe a two .,ass,B,ES2014d,feedback
"Yeah ,",ass,C,ES2014d,feedback
"cause we haven't got the double curve ,",inf,C,ES2014d,inform
so we can't like say it's completely true .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
Go for one . Yep .,ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
Right .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
But it's pretty close .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
We've got almost everything we can .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
Okay . Right .,stl,D,ES2014d,
Okay .,ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space .,off,D,ES2014d,commissive
"So , false is seven , true is one , and ",inf,D,ES2014d,inform

you think ?,el.ass,D,ES2014d,
Yeah .,ass,C,ES2014d,feedback
Okay .,ass,D,ES2014d,feedback
"Yeah , why not not ,",ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
m m maybe nearer three .,sug,A,ES2014d,directive
"Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um ",inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Two three .,fra,A,ES2014d,

Uh-huh .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
and we're not going for these options .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
This this is just this is just for like the look .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So ,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,ES2014d,feedback
"Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .",inf,C,ES2014d,inform
"Yeah ,",ass,D,ES2014d,feedback
so that ,fra,D,ES2014d,
so sh should we go for a a two on that ?,el.inf,D,ES2014d,
Okay .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Kay .,stl,D,ES2014d,
"And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?",el.ass,D,ES2014d,

So it doesn't ,fra,D,ES2014d,
It's pretty ,fra,D,ES2014d,
The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the ,ass,D,ES2014d,feedback
No,ass,B,ES2014d,feedback
may is maybe about neutral,sug,B,ES2014d,directive

"Well , wait a minute .",oth,A,ES2014d,
In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
I would give it more than a four .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Right .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform

the other functions we've got in are are more at the ,fra,A,ES2014d,

Mm-hmm .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback

I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product .,off,D,ES2014d,commissive
How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?,el.inf,C,ES2014d,
Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform

well plastic rather than rubber . ,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Okay . But I ,fra,D,ES2014d,
That that that would make the significant difference .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
You could either ,fra,A,ES2014d,
you could have it ,fra,A,ES2014d,
"If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor ,",inf,A,ES2014d,inform

Mm-hmm .,bck,B,ES2014d,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,ES2014d,feedback
And that would enable you to to do it .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform
Okay .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
"So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation ,",inf,B,ES2014d,inform

"Well , we've got special form .",inf,A,ES2014d,inform
"Now that would be one button ,",inf,A,ES2014d,inform

Yeah .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform

they'll still be fine for the for the price .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform
Okay .,bck,A,ES2014d,feedback

Okay .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,ES2014d,feedback
So we only ne we only need two for that .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform
Okay .,bck,A,ES2014d,feedback
Cause I mean these these are moulded .,inf,D,ES2014d,inform

"Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think .",ass,A,ES2014d,feedback
Right .,bck,D,ES2014d,feedback
And we've got special form is the one apple .,inf,A,ES2014d,inform

the volume ones should stand out a bit .,inf,C,ES2014d,inform
Maybe that'll be a second supplement .,inf,B,ES2014d,inform

so we're still within budget on that . Um ,inf,B,ES2014d,inform

"So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do .",off,D,IS1009b,commissive
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Hmm hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Mm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another ,",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those .,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"So that was um what I meant there ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money ,",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"and we want it to be an impulse purchase ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Mm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
And take out their wallet and buy it .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
So it's gotta be really attractive,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
and it ,stl,D,IS1009b,
"but it's gotta go to market by September ,",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it,off,D,IS1009b,commissive
and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view .,off,D,IS1009b,commissive
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
"So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,",off,D,IS1009b,commissive
Mm mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know ,",off,D,IS1009b,commissive
What features .,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
"what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
cause we gotta sell this sizzle .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
S sellable . Yes .,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
Okay can we go to the next slide please ?,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything .,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
what'll be ,fra,D,IS1009b,
And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the TV , the VCR , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ?",off,A,IS1009b,commissive
I have to wind up ?,el.inf,D,IS1009b,
"Yeah , sure .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"because that's sort of outdated with the internet ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"and according to to higher management the it should only control the TV ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"Complicated , yeah , of course .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
and they are concerned with the time to market .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"Of course , yeah .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,stl,A,IS1009b,
Um and the ,stl,A,IS1009b,
"Okay , so that's something ",fra,D,IS1009b,
"and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"so it's only gonna be TV ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Okay,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
so ,fra,D,IS1009b,
but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm 'kay .,el.ass,A,IS1009b,
Okay .,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
"Alright ,",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
thanks for that .,be.pos,D,IS1009b,
Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
and that was thirty four percent,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address ,",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible ,",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use ,",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
and then the things about finding it,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate .,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Kay can we go to the next slide please ?,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Uh because once there's no be-back ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
They're never gonna come back and buy it .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use .",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"We have to have as few buttons as possible ,",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"because more buttons is more confusion ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it ,",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Okay that's uh about it for me right now .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
And uh,stl,A,IS1009b,
"who would be next , uh ,",oth,A,IS1009b,
I guess that would be you .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah 'kay .,off,C,IS1009b,commissive
Mm-hmm .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
You want me to get your slide show up ?,off,A,IS1009b,commissive
Yeah yeah sure .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Thank you .,be.pos,C,IS1009b,
And you are number three ?,el.inf,A,IS1009b,
"Number two ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Number two .,und,A,IS1009b,feedback
yeah .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah exactly .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Uh can you make it uh full screen please ?,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Okay .,off,A,IS1009b,commissive
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Yep .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"No ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
it's like a,stl,C,IS1009b,
well you you have to press here .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
The cup cup shape here ?,el.und,C,IS1009b,
"Yeah yeah , uh-huh .",und,A,IS1009b,feedback
The thir third .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Yeah exactly .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"There , mm-hmm .",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Um can you go to the next sli slide please ?,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Mm-hmm .,off,A,IS1009b,commissive
The metal is like uh,fra,C,IS1009b,
in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
It takes the power from a battery,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
and then um uh th,stl,C,IS1009b,
this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a TV or a air conditioner , something like that so .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
the device should know what the frequency is .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Signal .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"and the TV it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Receive .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Multi-purpose .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Yo and it's ,fra,A,IS1009b,
yeah ,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Uh yeah .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
but it's so .,fra,A,IS1009b,
Um .,stl,C,IS1009b,
Yep .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
like there should be a user user in interface,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"So uh you can control whatever you want ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and TV can perform the actions .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Mm okay .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
So can you go to the next slide please ?,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Okay .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller,off,C,IS1009b,commissive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also ,",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
"if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"And there should be a child lock ,",sug,C,IS1009b,directive
like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah well ,stl,A,IS1009b,
"yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . Mm-hmm .",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Well we already eliminated that .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
but it uh,stl,C,IS1009b,
yeah yeah yeah,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Eliminated .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
"so it's it's okay , yeah , yeah .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
And uh different shapes that we can do,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
and um so that uh ,fra,C,IS1009b,
"Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , yeah , yeah",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"and colours also , different colours , and ",sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Yeah I ,fra,A,IS1009b,
And that ,stl,D,IS1009b,
Mm-hmm colours .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
you you say that won't add too much to the budget ?,el.inf,D,IS1009b,
To d the shape is uh ,fra,D,IS1009b,
"No no no , it won't uh I don't think it will be like ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more ,fra,C,IS1009b,
It just build a mould basically and uh you know .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah yeah .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Yes exactly .,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or ,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?,el.ass,D,IS1009b,
Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Oh yes .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Is that gonna be a possible ?,el.ass,D,IS1009b,
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
Cause that might help with the marketing .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
I think ,stl,A,IS1009b,
I think we will have to look at the budget on that,sug,A,IS1009b,directive
Yeah that will be ,fra,C,IS1009b,
"but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know .",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah yeah .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Silly for children .,sug,A,IS1009b,directive
silly for children,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , for children , yeah exactly .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Like an animal or ,sug,A,IS1009b,directive
or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . ,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"Like a doll , or ",sug,B,IS1009b,directive
"Yeah , that's what , yeah .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , exactly . Yeah .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons .,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations ,",sug,C,IS1009b,directive
"like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Mm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Well , I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"Yep , yeah .",bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
The changing modes was something ,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Yeah , it's like you know yeah .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"I mean you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , yeah .",bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"changing modes is nothing for us ,",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
but people who ,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
"Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
N and ,fra,D,IS1009b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"Yeah , yes .",bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Something else .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
and they're very frustrated you know .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel ,",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
and um you don't feel the mode change .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , yeah you don't ",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"us yeah yeah , usually . Yeah .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"Yeah shapes also , different shapes .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it .",sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Yeah that will ,fra,C,IS1009b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Channels .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
But we'll get to that with you .,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
"Yeah ,",bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"Mm , mm-hmm .",bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"yeah ,",bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh ,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
"That's right , yeah . Now that's a good point . Yeah .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
So yeah .,stl,C,IS1009b,
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock,sug,C,IS1009b,directive
it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's ,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"Yeah , that's that's a good that's a good one ,",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , and we display a clock .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Mm yeah .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback

Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
And uh bulbs .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the TV is on suppose ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Hmm .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Then it will be like if you switch on your TV through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Maybe we can have that . Whenever the TV is on , remote controller will have a light .",sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
And then uh infrared bulbs .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback

"and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything ,",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
so there should be wires .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
To keep the remote ?,el.inf,B,IS1009b,

Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"That's it , that's it from me now .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there ? Or ,el.sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Um .,stl,C,IS1009b,
"Well , you don't have to .",sug,A,IS1009b,directive
"Uh it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Okay . So it might be helpful if we had a look at that .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah if you want .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"Okay ,",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , it's okay .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
thank you .,be.pos,D,IS1009b,
Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy ?,sug,D,IS1009b,directive

You're three .,und,A,IS1009b,feedback
I can make it full ?,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
Would you want it full full screen ?,el.inf,A,IS1009b,
Yes yes yes .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm ? Okay .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,stl,B,IS1009b,
As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah can you please go onto the next slide ?,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
"Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the TV and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the TV .",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
There should be a signal,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
On the on on the remote .,el.inf,A,IS1009b,
Yes . Yes .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
"Yeah , mm-hmm .",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
"So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the TV will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Right .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
"and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel .",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Yes .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"By your child , mm-hmm .",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
And uh the uh the uh and the ,stl,B,IS1009b,
one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Uh t the remote should be compact,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV television .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T in alphabet for more compactability .,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
And uh and uh,stl,B,IS1009b,
"and it is one more point which I noted it down ,",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"Mm , 'kay .",bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
"a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight PM then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock ,",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Mm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
"Yeah , sure .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .,inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"And an alarm clock , yeah that should that should be okay .",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Yes ,",ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
"and as John Reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently .",sug,B,IS1009b,directive
So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
"so that if a child plays with a remote , he uh he should not be harmed in any way .",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"And findings , uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used ,",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
"there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities ,",inf,B,IS1009b,inform
there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
and there are uh ,fra,B,IS1009b,
So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
Next slide .,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
And these are my few personal preferences,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
like it can be used for a multipurpose use .,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
"Not , uh no",ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
uh like it can it can be used as a TV control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
"and it should have a child lock ,",sug,B,IS1009b,directive
and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that .,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
"And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .",sug,B,IS1009b,directive
"It's like a t okay , it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"Timer , yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Timer . Yeah and then you can use a timer as well .,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
Yes .,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah that's it .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
"Uh okay ,",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
now I have ,oth,A,IS1009b,
"On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
"And uh what function , working design , how how does it work .",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
So these are the two things we should come up wit with .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Um .,stl,A,IS1009b,
I guess in many ways everybody .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Everybody who has a TV .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"Mm , TV , yeah .",bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
TV television we was .,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah ,",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"Don't TV , yeah .",bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
There are a few but in general not .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
but I think within the target group we have subgroups .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
We have ,stl,A,IS1009b,
"we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"So this these are just some thoughts I have on it ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing ,el.ass,A,IS1009b,
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups .",el.ass,A,IS1009b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone .",inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours .,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
That's right .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Different colours .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
"You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know",sug,A,IS1009b,directive
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
You can make a banana shaped one . ,sug,D,IS1009b,directive
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"yeah , for example you know .",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Mm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"But the question is really , who is our target group .",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Do we look at one target group ?,el.ass,A,IS1009b,
And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have,el.ass,A,IS1009b,
uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group,sug,A,IS1009b,directive
how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to,el.inf,A,IS1009b,
Respect .,el.inf,D,IS1009b,
respect ?,el.inf,A,IS1009b,
Mm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,stl,B,IS1009b,
No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty,sug,B,IS1009b,directive
Right .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .",sug,B,IS1009b,directive
With with ,fra,A,IS1009b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
"We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know .",sug,C,IS1009b,directive
Well that's that's ,fra,A,IS1009b,
But in a family ,stl,B,IS1009b,
"in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes .",ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
"Children and everybody , yeah .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh ,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah of course that we can do ,",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know .",sug,C,IS1009b,directive
"What about the electronics ? That's not really gonna change much , is it ?",el.inf,D,IS1009b,
Yeah .,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Cost effective .,inf,B,IS1009b,inform
"No , it it doesn't cost , yeah .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
"That that w that won't change much , will it uh ?",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
No ,bck,A,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah . Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter .,ass,C,IS1009b,feedback
"The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
I d I wouldn't think so .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups .",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"I mean the basic design I understand will be the same ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
So that remains to s to be seen,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a TV .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"That's right ,",ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
and can we ,stl,D,IS1009b,
"can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?",el.ass,D,IS1009b,
"Yeah , well that's that's the question .",ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
Hmm hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
And in that case we could probabl,fra,D,IS1009b,
moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ?,el.inf,D,IS1009b,
Um you as an industrial person ?,el.inf,D,IS1009b,
"Uh no . Mm , I I I don't think no . It's not .",inf,C,IS1009b,inform
Well maybe there's ,stl,A,IS1009b,
there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ?,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
"and maybe something like that ,",sug,A,IS1009b,directive
that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .,sug,A,IS1009b,directive
Well there's a real idea yeah .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Right .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .",ass,C,IS1009b,feedback

"but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package ,",inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Uh yeah .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009b,feedback
An alternate package .,inf,D,IS1009b,inform
an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
Yeah . Okay .,ass,D,IS1009b,feedback
But uh yeah I I have a doubt,ass,B,IS1009b,feedback
like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people .,el.ass,B,IS1009b,
Well I think I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote,ass,A,IS1009b,feedback
"Yeah , but uh ",fra,C,IS1009b,
"Well I think we can only aff ,",fra,D,IS1009b,
yeah .,bck,D,IS1009b,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback

Mm-hmm .,bck,B,IS1009b,feedback
um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um ,sug,A,IS1009b,directive
Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message .,inf,A,IS1009b,inform
"Warning , finish meeting now . ",inf,D,IS1009b,inform

But I think ,stl,A,IS1009b,
"If we do some more research , maybe we .",sug,C,IS1009b,directive

meaning gathering i suggestions,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
Um it's also an item that people lose a lot .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
So we should address that .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
"And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use .",inf,A,IS1009c,inform
"In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive ,",inf,A,IS1009c,inform
or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
"so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact ,",inf,A,IS1009c,inform
"cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work .",inf,A,IS1009c,inform
Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
Hmm .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip,inf,A,IS1009c,inform

Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
"Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television .",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
"For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen .",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
"Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture .",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Now there should be a memory switch .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
There should be a mute button .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
"Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh TV , but he he can reduce the sound ,",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the TV .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
"So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
"which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television ,",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
"for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel .",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
So the TV will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform

And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one .,sug,C,IS1009c,directive
And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform

It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Like you have got a signal by pressing a button .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"The sensor on the TV can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform

"uh sorry , ther there is a diode .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
Can you go go on to the next slide .,sug,C,IS1009c,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
So uh this is the circuit board .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
The green one is a circuit board .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
It's not exactly wires we are using .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
It's just printing something on a board .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"So th that green uh thing is a circuit board ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
uh th it will,stl,C,IS1009c,
"it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Transmit .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
"Can you go to the next slide , please .",sug,C,IS1009c,directive
Uh so this is ,stl,C,IS1009c,
these are the circuits un underneath the buttons .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ?",el.inf,C,IS1009c,
Mm-hmm .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
They they are the circuits .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Yes .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"Next , please .",sug,C,IS1009c,directive
And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Okay .,bck,D,IS1009c,feedback
Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
"Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
uh or we can use solar sells .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Hmm , that's interesting .",ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
Uh .,stl,C,IS1009c,
Yeah .,ass,C,IS1009c,feedback
Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Uh usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
Um .,stl,C,IS1009c,
Okay .,stl,A,IS1009c,
Yeah .,ass,C,IS1009c,feedback
And you have more pictures .,el.inf,A,IS1009c,
Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
"Yeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide , I think . Um .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
but titanium we can't use .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
um also infra it includes the infrared se sender .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker .,inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"An Yeah , that's it .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"It's all for me now ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
thank you .,be.pos,C,IS1009c,
"Okay ,",ass,A,IS1009c,feedback
well thank you .,be.pos,A,IS1009c,
Any particular comments by anybody ?,el.ass,A,IS1009c,
"Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?",el.inf,D,IS1009c,
"No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009c,feedback
"Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons .,sug,C,IS1009c,directive
Um .,fra,D,IS1009c,
We'll just go for push buttons,ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
"Yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . Yeah .",ass,C,IS1009c,feedback
for in the interest of cost .,ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
Push-buttons .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
Yeah .,ass,C,IS1009c,feedback
Okay .,ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
We don't have a lot of time left,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
"and we will still have to make a decision ,",sug,A,IS1009c,directive
and the marketing expert has to present her her thing .,sug,A,IS1009c,directive
Okay .,ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
Go right to my first my next slide .,sug,D,IS1009c,directive
Uh okay .,off,A,IS1009c,commissive
"Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition ,",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have ,",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
And I would encourage you all to do the same .,sug,D,IS1009c,directive
"Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful .",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
Um people like something that really fits in their hand .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
Kay .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
Simple is beautiful .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"They don't want to have to squint at small print um ,",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible ,",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
and they don't care for the mode thing .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
They want each button to do something .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
And eye-catching is important .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing .",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"Go ahead ,",sug,D,IS1009c,directive
I'm trying to finish fast for you .,off,D,IS1009c,commissive
"Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition .",sug,D,IS1009c,directive
"Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others ,",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign .,sug,D,IS1009c,directive
"If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere .",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product .",sug,D,IS1009c,directive
And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal .,inf,D,IS1009c,inform
"They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them .",inf,D,IS1009c,inform
So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .,sug,D,IS1009c,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
Okay .,stl,A,IS1009c,
Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone .,inf,A,IS1009c,inform
And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote .,sug,A,IS1009c,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009c,feedback
And uh so what do we think on the concept,el.sug,A,IS1009c,directive
of the remote ?,el.sug,A,IS1009c,directive
"You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?",sug,D,IS1009c,directive
"Uh yes ,",off,B,IS1009c,commissive
Y ,fra,A,IS1009c,
I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .,sug,B,IS1009c,directive
Okay . Mm-hmm . ,ass,A,IS1009c,feedback
Okay .,ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ?,el.ass,D,IS1009c,
"Yeah , but w",fra,C,IS1009c,
This could be uh one feature which could be sellable .,ass,B,IS1009c,feedback
Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature .,ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
I think that's ,fra,A,IS1009c,
"That that be really good , yeah , I agree with that .",ass,D,IS1009c,feedback
"Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work ,",ass,C,IS1009c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,IS1009c,feedback
"because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Distance problem ?,el.inf,D,IS1009c,
"Yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,IS1009c,feedback
"like maybe different people will be having different voices ,",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
so it like it's uh everything so i,fra,C,IS1009c,
Uh .,stl,D,IS1009c,
"Well , you you teach You have to teach uh ",ass,A,IS1009c,feedback
"So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think .",inf,C,IS1009c,inform
"No , it's it's , uh yeah ,",stl,B,IS1009c,
"it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
"For example , you have a TV system , I'm the user and my family members are the user ,",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
"I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning ,",inf,B,IS1009c,inform
"Yeah , but ",fra,C,IS1009c,
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
So I'll say just good morning and the TV will switch on .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback
It will recognise my voice and will switch on .,inf,B,IS1009c,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009c,feedback

Thank you .,be.pos,C,IS1009c,
Thank you .,be.pos,B,IS1009c,
Well hi everyone again .,be.pos,A,IS1009d,
Hello .,be.pos,B,IS1009d,
Hello .,be.pos,C,IS1009d,
Hello,be.pos,D,IS1009d,
Um ,stl,A,IS1009d,
like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting,off,A,IS1009d,commissive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009d,feedback
and so here we go .,oth,A,IS1009d,
Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Designer . ,inf,B,IS1009d,inform
designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
and um it is to send messages of course to the TV .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Um .,stl,A,IS1009d,
"Should be child friendly design with few buttons ,",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Um ,stl,A,IS1009d,
And she was challenged on that point ,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
that's right . ,ass,A,IS1009d,feedback
Yes . ,ass,B,IS1009d,feedback
"But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator ,",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
and if possible a rechargeable battery .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Uh and of course a circuit board .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Okay .,bck,D,IS1009d,feedback
and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
She feels that's really what people want today .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser ,",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip ,",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"should be trendy design , compact and strong ,",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
and should have buttons .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform

And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition,sug,D,IS1009d,directive
"and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it .",ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
"Um , next slide please .",sug,D,IS1009d,directive
"Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype .",ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
"I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
so we we've got that .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
"The size is small ,",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted .,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
"We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible ,",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
we'll have the soft buttons,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
"and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
so that's nice .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it .,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
"So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store .",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
Fee selling .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
"They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it .",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
Um so they'll be our main selling points .,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
So um ,stl,D,IS1009d,
th those have been fulfilled by your prototype,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
and go ahead to the next slide please .,sug,D,IS1009d,directive
"Okay , so um the shape um I think is a a one .",ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
"That's really , really excellent shape .",ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
The size is small um,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
"and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel .",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
I think that it's ,stl,D,IS1009d,
I think that it's plenty small enough to sell,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
but I think we're sort of right ,fra,D,IS1009d,
the scale is one to seven .,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
And our colour I think is great .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
"And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality ,",ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
Um I just realised one thing .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Yes .,oth,D,IS1009d,
In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
Ah .,oth,D,IS1009d,
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
"And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
"Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?",el.inf,D,IS1009d,
"Eight , eight twenty , yes .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Eight twenty so ,inf,C,IS1009d,inform
And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend .,inf,D,IS1009d,inform
"We have um four euros , yeah",ass,C,IS1009d,feedback
I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty .,ass,A,IS1009d,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009d,feedback
Well um that's ,fra,D,IS1009d,
"But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much .",inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009d,feedback
So um we just have to beware of that .,sug,A,IS1009d,directive
I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .,sug,A,IS1009d,directive
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
"Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality .",inf,D,IS1009d,inform
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .,sug,D,IS1009d,directive
"Yeah ,",bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
"Yes ,",bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
yes .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
"Yeah , still .",bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,A,IS1009d,feedback
As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . ,inf,D,IS1009d,inform

Well it's also you can't really try it out,ass,A,IS1009d,feedback

Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?,el.ass,D,IS1009d,
Uh .,stl,A,IS1009d,
Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity .,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
Um .,stl,A,IS1009d,
Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ?,el.ass,A,IS1009d,
Maybe we can ,fra,C,IS1009d,

We can make the buttons few buttons smaller .,sug,C,IS1009d,directive
"Uh I think they are quite big ,",ass,C,IS1009d,feedback
so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that .,sug,C,IS1009d,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009d,feedback
Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
"Yeah , definitely .",bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
Voices .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
So that that's where we're gonna have to do ,stl,D,IS1009d,

"Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons .",ass,C,IS1009d,feedback
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback

the volume control .,sug,D,IS1009d,directive
Maybe we can put that all on one button .,sug,D,IS1009d,directive
Hmm .,bck,C,IS1009d,feedback
Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .,sug,D,IS1009d,directive

Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget,inf,A,IS1009d,inform
And maybe ,fra,B,IS1009d,
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009d,feedback
"and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things .",ass,A,IS1009d,feedback
No .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser .,sug,A,IS1009d,directive

um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody,ass,A,IS1009d,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,IS1009d,feedback
and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit .,ass,A,IS1009d,feedback
And we used the slide because it was better positioned .,ass,D,IS1009d,feedback
Yes .,bck,B,IS1009d,feedback

"And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation .",inf,A,TS3003a,inform
So that's a bit what you're going to do .,inf,A,TS3003a,inform
But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .,inf,A,TS3003a,inform
Then we've got our first tool training .,inf,A,TS3003a,inform
"We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here ,",inf,A,TS3003a,inform
so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first .,ass,A,TS3003a,feedback
As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board .,inf,A,TS3003a,inform
Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side .,inf,A,TS3003a,inform
Here are some functions .,inf,A,TS3003a,inform

So okay . Uh,stl,A,TS3003a,
that's very simple,ass,A,TS3003a,feedback

But first this phase .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Um first an announcement .,off,A,TS3003b,commissive
There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform

and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
uh which have been sent to me .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
So,stl,A,TS3003b,
we've got forty minutes for all of it .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
So,stl,A,TS3003b,
I suggest um let's start with the first presentation .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive

Um who wants to be first ?,el.sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Think I'll go first .,off,D,TS3003b,commissive
Okay .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
So ,stl,A,TS3003b,
Just maybe it's easier if you um ,fra,A,TS3003b,
Yeah,stl,A,TS3003b,
I think you will tell your presentation as well . Just which function you have,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
and what you're gonna talk about . ,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Kay .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
My name is Freek Van Ponnen .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
I'm the Market Expert .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
But you already knew that .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um I've done some research .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
where we observed um users operating remote controls .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
We had one hundred of these uh test subjects .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Well,stl,D,TS3003b,
"these are three quite astonishing results , I thought .",ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Um remotes are being considered ugly .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
F,fra,D,TS3003b,
uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
So ,stl,D,TS3003b,
Um in addition remotes were not very functional .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
So,stl,D,TS3003b,
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
some things .,oth,D,TS3003b,
Then we did some research to the most relevant functions .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
The power button got a nine .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
And teletext got a six and a half .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Then there are some one-time use function .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
That's what I like to call them .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
"That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons .",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
"Which are not really used very frequently ,",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
but are still considered to be of some importance .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Then these are the ,fra,D,TS3003b,
This is the market .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um they like to use new f new functions .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
But they also are very critical .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
They won't spend their money very easily .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
So Um,stl,D,TS3003b,
the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
They are not really very interested in features .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
"Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market ,",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Um The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused RS RSI .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um this is certainly something to take into account .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
"And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control .",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Besides of course that the remote must look very nice .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
"And the functionality As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons ,",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
I think we should make very few buttons .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Cause they're used most,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
and so they should be robust .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
They shouldn't break down easily .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
"Um Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room ,",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
it might be,fra,D,TS3003b,
and I say might be,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
But it might be a good idea to make a docking station .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
"And this would , could get a button in it",sug,D,TS3003b,directive
which would send a signal to the remote,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
which would then beep .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
So you'd know where it is in the room .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
But up till forty five it remains feasible .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
This would also greatly increase the production costs,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Okay .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
That would be all .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform

Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet,inf,B,TS3003b,inform
"and not much information about it , Um about uh interface",inf,B,TS3003b,inform

what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are .,sug,B,TS3003b,directive
So uh,stl,B,TS3003b,
like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button .,sug,B,TS3003b,directive

Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device .,sug,B,TS3003b,directive

Hmm .,bck,D,TS3003b,feedback

Well,stl,D,TS3003b,
it would certainly make a fancy design .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003b,feedback
But the It wouldn't be very robust .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
So ,stl,D,TS3003b,
It's very fragile,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
and you can get scratches on it .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
That is true .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
That's right .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah that's true .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
We would have to look into that .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ?,el.ass,A,TS3003b,
Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Uh .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
That's . Okay .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback

Uh it's not too much .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Okay . ,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Okay,stl,C,TS3003b,
I've got a presentation about the working design .,off,C,TS3003b,commissive
Um first about how it works .,off,C,TS3003b,commissive
It's really simple of course .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
Everybody knows how a remote works .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
The user presses a button .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
"The remote determines what button it is ,",inf,C,TS3003b,inform
uses the infrared to send a signal to the TV .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
"The TV switches to the frequency , or what function it is .",inf,C,TS3003b,inform
So,stl,C,TS3003b,
we've got um the the plate .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
It gots conductive disks for every button .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
"When the user presses a button , a signal got sent ,",inf,C,TS3003b,inform
goes to the LED,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
and transmits tranmi transmits its to the TV .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
"It's a very simple device , technically speaking .",inf,C,TS3003b,inform
So,stl,C,TS3003b,
this is a schematic overview .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
You've got the buttons .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
The power source .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
"And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip .",inf,C,TS3003b,inform
The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
Well um,stl,C,TS3003b,
"I think we should use default materials , simple plastics .",sug,C,TS3003b,directive
"Keep the inner workings simple ,",sug,C,TS3003b,directive
so it's robust .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
"Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface ,",sug,C,TS3003b,directive
because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
"And uh you only have to design a remote once ,",inf,C,TS3003b,inform
and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
So,stl,C,TS3003b,
"it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself .",ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
That's it .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
Okay .,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
Thank you .,be.pos,A,TS3003b,

so I'm here to mess things up,off,A,TS3003b,commissive
and uh tell you some new uh requirements .,off,A,TS3003b,commissive
"Um that's ,",fra,A,TS3003b,
we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for TV .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Um that's because uh it will be too complex,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Okay .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
"and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions .",ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
So it has to be simple .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext ,",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target ,",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert .,be.pos,A,TS3003b,
Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
So we have to find a market which is above forty plus,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
uh but which will suit our,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"uh remote control ,",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
and the other way round .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works .",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
So,stl,A,TS3003b,
I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Yeah .,oth,A,TS3003b,
So,stl,D,TS3003b,
is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?,el.inf,D,TS3003b,
Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um ,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah,stl,D,TS3003b,
cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
And new TVs will have internet access on them .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
"But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a TV with internet access",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
within the next like twenty years is very slim .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
I'm pretty much against it .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Against the no teletext ?,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yes . ,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Um ,stl,A,TS3003b,
"Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small .",ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
"But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
forty ,fra,B,TS3003b,
Yeah,stl,A,TS3003b,
it's it is ,fra,A,TS3003b,
Standard remote .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
pretty,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
No,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
I think we can,fra,A,TS3003b,
and not innovative,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
remote control .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
which were also mentioned .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach",sug,A,TS3003b,directive
because it is forty percent of the market .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
And um,stl,A,TS3003b,
"if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yes,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
but it's not the biggest part of the market .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
No .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
"And besides that , they're not very critical",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
so ,fra,D,TS3003b,
I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
"But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it .",el.ass,A,TS3003b,
So,stl,A,TS3003b,
let's try it .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
No .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
because they are critical,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
and they they want to have a fancy remote control .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
"People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work ,",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003b,feedback
"I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?",sug,C,TS3003b,directive
So ,stl,D,TS3003b,
Yeah .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
It's a big success .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yeah,stl,C,TS3003b,
"if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .",ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
I haven't heard of it .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Very big success .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,D,TS3003b,feedback
Uh . I think so as well .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality .,sug,C,TS3003b,directive
We just,sug,C,TS3003b,directive
"change our focus on the project ,",sug,C,TS3003b,directive
and I think we can uh we can sell this .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
Uh I simply think um,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people ,",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
"Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . ",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yes .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yes .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
Okay . Um ,stl,A,TS3003b,
But obviously the board tends to disagree .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
No,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
"we we haven't voted yet ,",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
so ,fra,A,TS3003b,
Uh I think teletext can be uh,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
"um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost ,",sug,A,TS3003b,directive
"because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well ,",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
but I don't think it will be a problem .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Or is teletext a ,fra,A,TS3003b,
But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles .,inf,B,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003b,feedback
"Yeah , also .",ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
So it's ,fra,B,TS3003b,
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
So,stl,A,TS3003b,
I suggest uh ,fra,A,TS3003b,
I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
It's ,fra,B,TS3003b,
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
Is anybody um really against teletext ?,el.ass,A,TS3003b,
No .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
No ?,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
"Just that , that we just keep the teletext .",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles .",ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
"Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles ,",sug,A,TS3003b,directive
which is instantly on the remote control .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
Yeah yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
"For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles ,",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
and they push the button,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
and they get the big subtitles .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Uh that's a good idea .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah . Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
Um so,stl,A,TS3003b,
I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um ,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
"Functionality should be few buttons , you said .",inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yes .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,TS3003b,feedback
So to keep it simple .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
But I don't think that's really an issue any more,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
cause ,fra,D,TS3003b,
Well,stl,D,TS3003b,
might be .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
If it's only for televi,fra,B,TS3003b,
"But I mean it , if it's only for TV you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway .",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
"You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel ,",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
No .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
"volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
but ,fra,D,TS3003b,
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003b,feedback
But do you need ,fra,A,TS3003b,
I think if you if you only l,fra,D,TS3003b,
"So we can s we can skip the display ,",sug,B,TS3003b,directive
so uh we don't need it .,inf,B,TS3003b,inform
But do you need the buttons for one to zero .,el.inf,A,TS3003b,
Nah .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Maybe c we can ,fra,A,TS3003b,
Uh ,stl,B,TS3003b,
Think if you're gonna include teletext you do .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
I think many people like to use that .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Maybe we can use uh ,fra,A,TS3003b,
"Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
"No ,",ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
maybe we can implement the scroll button ?,el.ass,A,TS3003b,
Or a joystick like ?,el.ass,A,TS3003b,
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
There are other ways too .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or ,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
That's true,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
but um I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
And so you would need like the TV would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many TVs have that .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
And besides that it's um ,fra,C,TS3003b,
If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
They're not used to using scroll buttons .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform
That's right .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .,sug,C,TS3003b,directive
Mm-hmm .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Mm .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
the numbers yeah .,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah,stl,A,TS3003b,
"they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display ,",sug,A,TS3003b,directive
and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it .,sug,A,TS3003b,directive
But I think there won't be very much buttons .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
Or there don't have to be a lot .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
"But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a TV , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible .",ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
"Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV ,",inf,D,TS3003b,inform
which already only have the minimum number of buttons .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
I don't think there's much to be gained in that area .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
The number of buttons ?,el.inf,A,TS3003b,
Hmm .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
I think it's very important in the in the design .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with ,fra,A,TS3003b,
That is true,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the TV .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
To operate only the TV yeah .,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a TV there's simply not a lot of buttons required .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
There's not a lot of functions required,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
No .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
No .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
So .,stl,A,TS3003b,
So,stl,D,TS3003b,
I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Kay .,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
So,stl,A,TS3003b,
we can ,fra,A,TS3003b,
That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Yeah . That's right .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
because we didn't have the time to market a lot .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform
Yeah .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
So,stl,A,TS3003b,
you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .,el.ass,A,TS3003b,
Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons .,el.ass,A,TS3003b,
Maybe .,ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
Well yeah,stl,D,TS3003b,
"I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons",ass,D,TS3003b,feedback
and ,fra,D,TS3003b,
But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Mm . No .,und,A,TS3003b,feedback
Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ?,el.inf,A,TS3003b,
It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy .,inf,C,TS3003b,inform

"And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible",inf,C,TS3003b,inform
No .,bck,A,TS3003b,feedback
yeah .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,stl,A,TS3003b,
No .,bck,B,TS3003b,feedback
Because I think that's uh ,fra,A,TS3003b,
That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Yes .,ass,C,TS3003b,feedback
or very ,fra,A,TS3003b,
Hmm .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
That's a nice requirement .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Docking station .,oth,A,TS3003b,
So,stl,C,TS3003b,
we're just gonna focus on the extras ?,el.ass,C,TS3003b,
I think so .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah .,und,C,TS3003b,feedback
Mm .,und,B,TS3003b,feedback
Yeah,stl,D,TS3003b,
I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a,sug,D,TS3003b,directive
Yeah .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
like to have extra in a new remote control .,sug,D,TS3003b,directive

well,stl,D,TS3003b,
fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .,inf,D,TS3003b,inform

audio signal should be possible as well .,ass,A,TS3003b,feedback
I think it's not too expensive .,inf,A,TS3003b,inform
No .,ass,B,TS3003b,feedback
Uh another,el.ass,A,TS3003b,
point is the LCD screen .,el.ass,A,TS3003b,

this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
It's the conceptual design meeting .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
you're going to show me in a few minutes .,sug,A,TS3003c,directive
Um but first I'll show you the agenda .,off,A,TS3003c,commissive
Uh first the opening .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Then we have three presentations .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
How we're going to make it .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
And then we're closing .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
We have about forty minutes .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Uh so I suggest let's get started .,sug,A,TS3003c,directive
Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?,el.inf,A,TS3003c,
No ?,el.inf,A,TS3003c,
No .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Everything fine ?,el.ass,A,TS3003c,
That's nice .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
Then a little uh thing about the last meeting .,off,A,TS3003c,commissive
Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
"Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information .",inf,A,TS3003c,inform
And we are going to use default materials .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ?,el.ass,A,TS3003c,
No ?,el.ass,A,TS3003c,
"These are just the the things we thought of ,",inf,A,TS3003c,inform
"so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know .",sug,A,TS3003c,directive
And maybe we can uh work it out .,None,A,TS3003c,
And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
So,stl,A,TS3003c,
"now everybody knows what we're do we're doing ,",inf,A,TS3003c,inform
um I suggest let's get started with the presentations .,sug,A,TS3003c,directive
So,stl,A,TS3003c,
shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?,el.ass,A,TS3003c,
Sure .,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback
Okay .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
I'll start off then .,off,D,TS3003c,commissive
Good luck . ,be.pos,A,TS3003c,
Doh .,oth,D,TS3003c,
Kay,stl,D,TS3003c,
I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days .,off,D,TS3003c,commissive
Um we've done some market research .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
"We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
"And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Um okay,stl,D,TS3003c,
these are some overall findings .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Um most important thing is the fancy design .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
"Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
"Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Kay,stl,D,TS3003c,
these are some more group specific findings .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Uh the older people prefer dark colours .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
"Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
"Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Um this leads us to some personal preferences .,off,D,TS3003c,commissive
Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room .,sug,D,TS3003c,directive
Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs .,sug,D,TS3003c,directive
Just keep it simple,sug,D,TS3003c,directive
and ,fra,D,TS3003c,
Well,stl,D,TS3003c,
"the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest ,",sug,D,TS3003c,directive
because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
So this would be very important that we at least include these features .,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback
"Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
This is not really ,fra,D,TS3003c,
This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped .,sug,D,TS3003c,directive
"Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour .",sug,D,TS3003c,directive
The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money .,sug,D,TS3003c,directive
Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means .,sug,D,TS3003c,directive
That would be all .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Okay .,und,A,TS3003c,feedback
Thank you .,be.pos,A,TS3003c,

Mm no .,und,B,TS3003c,feedback
No ?,el.und,A,TS3003c,
"Okay ,",ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
we go on to the next one .,sug,A,TS3003c,directive
Um 'kay um yeah .,stl,B,TS3003c,
uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So uh um uh,stl,B,TS3003c,
that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So um,stl,B,TS3003c,
finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So,stl,B,TS3003c,
maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um ,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
Uh and uh using a little uh display .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So um,stl,B,TS3003c,
findings .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Um yeah,stl,B,TS3003c,
just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So uh,stl,B,TS3003c,
"only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down .",inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Um uh let's see . Um yeah and Uh,stl,B,TS3003c,
we uh need some uh new a attractive functions,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So uh,stl,B,TS3003c,
it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles .,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Um and yeah,stl,B,TS3003c,
overall um user-friendly .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So uh,stl,B,TS3003c,
using uh large large buttons . Um ,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
"Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal .",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
So uh uh yeah .,stl,B,TS3003c,
"And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
or A and,fra,B,TS3003c,
uh yeah .,stl,B,TS3003c,
Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um ,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
Let's see . Uh yeah .,stl,B,TS3003c,
"I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles ,",inf,B,TS3003c,inform
um just one button to keep it uh simple .,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles .,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
"Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles .",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
So uh Um Yeah,stl,B,TS3003c,
and w we have to keep uh in general buttons,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
uh so um,stl,B,TS3003c,
"we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel .",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on .,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
So um,stl,B,TS3003c,
made a little uh picture of uh it .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Um See . Um yeah .,stl,B,TS3003c,
"Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner ,",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So um ,stl,B,TS3003c,
"D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display .",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
Uh um you can put it uh on top .,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
"Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of looks at .",inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So uh um,stl,B,TS3003c,
"and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the ",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down .,ass,B,TS3003c,feedback
Um it's uh quite uh handy place .,ass,B,TS3003c,feedback
So um and uh,stl,B,TS3003c,
"all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh ",inf,B,TS3003c,inform
"Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it",sug,B,TS3003c,directive
so ,fra,B,TS3003c,
Okay .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
And that's it .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Uh thank you . ,be.pos,A,TS3003c,
Okay .,stl,C,TS3003c,
About the components design .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery,sug,C,TS3003c,directive
"or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch ,",sug,C,TS3003c,directive
which you just shake and it produces energy .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
"But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete .",inf,C,TS3003c,inform
So I don't think it's really an option .,ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
"Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing .",inf,C,TS3003c,inform
It's really up the the design that we're gonna use .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
"Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip .",sug,C,TS3003c,directive
"Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber .",sug,C,TS3003c,directive
"And the chip-set , um it says simple here ,",inf,C,TS3003c,inform
"but it should be advanced ,",sug,C,TS3003c,directive
because we're using an LCD uh screen .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
"And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood ,",inf,C,TS3003c,inform
but it raises the price,ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
"and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .",ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
Form should follow function overall .,sug,C,TS3003c,directive
Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy .,ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
But depends on what we want .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
I think we should disc discuss that .,sug,C,TS3003c,directive
"Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer .",inf,C,TS3003c,inform
And the chip-set uh really should be advanced,sug,C,TS3003c,directive
because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
And that's it .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
Okay .,und,A,TS3003c,feedback
Thank you .,be.pos,A,TS3003c,
So,stl,A,TS3003c,
that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .,sug,A,TS3003c,directive
Mm .,oth,A,TS3003c,
Kay . So,stl,A,TS3003c,
these are the points we have to discuss .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
"Um first I think we can talk about the energy source ,",sug,A,TS3003c,directive
"since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image .",inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Uh so,stl,A,TS3003c,
"uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .",el.inf,A,TS3003c,
Yes,stl,C,TS3003c,
w,fra,C,TS3003c,
there there are four options .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
We could use the basic normal battery .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003c,feedback
Uh a hand dynamo .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
But I don't think that's really an option .,ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
Okay . ,bck,A,TS3003c,feedback
You don't wanna swing before you can watch television .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003c,feedback
Uh solar cells .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
But not every room is very light,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
so it's not a very good option .,ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
No .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
Or the kinetic energy .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
Yeah . Okay .,und,A,TS3003c,feedback
And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?,el.inf,D,TS3003c,
Well,stl,C,TS3003c,
You just ,fra,D,TS3003c,
"y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up .",inf,C,TS3003c,inform
You use it and it works .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Yeah .,ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
Yeah .,und,A,TS3003c,feedback
Okay .,und,D,TS3003c,feedback
Nah .,und,B,TS3003c,feedback
Well,stl,D,TS3003c,
personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Yeah . That's true .,ass,C,TS3003c,feedback
And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Oh .,bck,C,TS3003c,feedback
And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback
get great popularity for our product .,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003c,feedback
But,fra,B,TS3003c,
Um wel,stl,D,TS3003c,
what's the function ?,el.inf,B,TS3003c,
Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Yeah,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback
"you could load up the batteries ,",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
B b,fra,B,TS3003c,
you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Okay,und,B,TS3003c,feedback
but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
Uh it's uh just a small display,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more .,inf,B,TS3003c,inform
So I believe one battery uh is just enough .,sug,B,TS3003c,directive
Uh ,bck,A,TS3003c,feedback
Uh so ,stl,B,TS3003c,
Uh well,stl,A,TS3003c,
I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
That's true . ,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback
And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Okay .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Yeah . That's true . Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003c,feedback
And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
"So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .",sug,A,TS3003c,directive
Okay .,und,B,TS3003c,feedback
"And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .",ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
Uh .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
That's safe .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?,el.inf,D,TS3003c,
Yeah . That's a good point .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
Mm I don't have any information on pricing .,inf,C,TS3003c,inform
So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .,off,C,TS3003c,commissive
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
"Cause in our earlier um market research ,",fra,D,TS3003c,
"if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .",el.ass,D,TS3003c,
"Yeah , sure . Go ahead .",ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
Um so,stl,D,TS3003c,
it was open here .,inf,D,TS3003c,inform
"Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
Well,stl,D,TS3003c,
"you can see here , our target group would not do that .",inf,D,TS3003c,inform
No .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
I would greatly advise not to do it .,ass,D,TS3003c,feedback

So now,stl,A,TS3003c,
for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote .,ass,A,TS3003c,feedback
So check out the corporate website maybe .,sug,A,TS3003c,directive
"The user interface design , it's the same story .",inf,A,TS3003c,inform

So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform

And then you'll get a message .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003c,feedback
So,stl,A,TS3003c,
that's uh basically it .,inf,A,TS3003c,inform
Maybe this one ?,oth,A,TS3003c,
Then we can save this one in the folders group .,off,A,TS3003c,commissive

Okay,stl,A,TS3003d,
this our last meeting .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
In this meeting we will discuss our final design .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
"And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project .",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
And then we're going to close the project today as well .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform

"And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design ,",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
and we will do the product evaluation .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
"Um , in order to do that we have this agenda .",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
We'll have the prototype presentation first .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Then we will look at the finance .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
"Because everything costs money ,",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
But we will see that later .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
"Then we will do the project uh evaluation ,",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
and the closing after that .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
We've got forty minutes .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
So we will be finished at half past three .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform

"So ,",stl,A,TS3003d,
if some yeah if somebody wants step forward .,sug,A,TS3003d,directive
Okay .,ass,C,TS3003d,feedback
Well,stl,C,TS3003d,
this is what me and Richard came up with .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
The default spot for the on-off button .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
The mute button just below that .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Then there's the volume and channel selectors .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Simple plus-minus button .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Uh we thought of a help button .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
"If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the LCD screen .",inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
So it's rather simple prototype .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .,sug,C,TS3003d,directive
Okay .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
"Um , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?",el.inf,D,TS3003d,
So ,stl,B,TS3003d,
Sure,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Yeah . Yeah .,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
uh just pop in at any time .,sug,C,TS3003d,directive
"Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .",inf,D,TS3003d,inform
"Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh ",inf,B,TS3003d,inform
So um ,stl,B,TS3003d,
You put it uh ,fra,B,TS3003d,
you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons .,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,TS3003d,feedback
And you ,fra,B,TS3003d,
"But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So ",inf,B,TS3003d,inform
Okay .,bck,D,TS3003d,feedback
Okay . Um Yeah .,und,D,TS3003d,feedback
Okay . Uh but um,stl,A,TS3003d,
I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Oh yeah ?,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons .,el.inf,A,TS3003d,
"I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this .",inf,C,TS3003d,inform
That's right .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
And well,stl,C,TS3003d,
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback
"the on-off button , it's it's a necessity .",inf,C,TS3003d,inform
You can't drop that one .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback
Yeah .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
"The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .",inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3003d,feedback
The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice .,sug,C,TS3003d,directive
So we could cancel that one .,sug,C,TS3003d,directive
I think the help button really is necessary,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Yeah yeah .,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback
because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Mm .,stl,A,TS3003d,
"Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh ",sug,B,TS3003d,directive
Long time .,sug,A,TS3003d,directive
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback
Yeah .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
If you put ,fra,A,TS3003d,
But m,fra,B,TS3003d,
Yeah .,stl,B,TS3003d,
We disc discuss that already .,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option .,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh ,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
Yeah . Okay .,und,A,TS3003d,feedback
"Well , ",stl,C,TS3003d,
you can't leave out the number buttons I guess .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
And uh ,fra,B,TS3003d,
Yeah .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
And ,fra,C,TS3003d,
Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform

Oh .,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback
Yeah .,ass,D,TS3003d,feedback
Okay .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
So it's rather basic already .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Yeah . Think so .,ass,D,TS3003d,feedback
That's what I pointed out earlier .,inf,D,TS3003d,inform
If you just make a control for just the TV there's just not much to gain here .,ass,D,TS3003d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
Yep .,bck,A,TS3003d,feedback
Okay . So,stl,A,TS3003d,
we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?,el.inf,A,TS3003d,
"Yeah ,",inf,C,TS3003d,inform
they're ,fra,C,TS3003d,
It's rather hard to draw on the white-board .,ass,C,TS3003d,feedback
"Yeah . Yeah ,",inf,B,TS3003d,inform
Just n normal plain buttons .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
it ,fra,B,TS3003d,
"But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff .",inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Yeah yeah .,stl,B,TS3003d,
Yeah . 'Kay .,und,A,TS3003d,feedback
"Just to recognise it ,",inf,B,TS3003d,inform
so uh ,stl,B,TS3003d,
Just for recognition .,ass,C,TS3003d,feedback
Uh yeah,stl,B,TS3003d,
and now we don't need uh LEDs,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
or um Y uh,stl,B,TS3003d,
No .,bck,A,TS3003d,feedback
"s some uh remote controls uh do it also ,",inf,B,TS3003d,inform
No .,bck,A,TS3003d,feedback
but um uh because we use the little display,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
we don't uh have to use it .,inf,B,TS3003d,inform
Uh so ,stl,B,TS3003d,
Yeah . Okay .,bck,A,TS3003d,feedback
So,stl,C,TS3003d,
and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Nay .,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
Yep .,bck,A,TS3003d,feedback
So they jump out .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
Okay .,stl,A,TS3003d,
And uh that's about it .,inf,C,TS3003d,inform
That's nice .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
"Then because we only have thirty minutes left ,",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
"I will move on to the finance part ,",off,A,TS3003d,commissive
"which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do .",ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
If we see ,sug,A,TS3003d,directive
"I don't know if I've filled in correctly ,",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
so just correct me if you see uh something wrong .,sug,A,TS3003d,directive
I counted two batteries .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
But maybe we can also use one .,sug,A,TS3003d,directive
I don't know if it's possible .,el.inf,A,TS3003d,
Since it rechargeable .,inf,D,TS3003d,inform
It's rechargeable . That's right .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
Yeah we can,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback

Okay .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
That's two Euros off . ,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Kay . ,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
We need the advanced chip .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
So there's not much to uh to save there .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Yep .,bck,C,TS3003d,feedback
Here we have the single curves .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
"Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Mm .,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
"I don't know ,",ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
"but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control .",ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback
Yes .,ass,C,TS3003d,feedback
I think we have to keep that .,sug,A,TS3003d,directive
Yeah .,ass,B,TS3003d,feedback
Then we have the case material supplements .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
It's plastic .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
It's the cheapest one we need .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
So that's uh not much to save either .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
But then the biggest costs are the buttons .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low .,sug,A,TS3003d,directive
Okay .,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3003d,feedback
"Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,",inf,A,TS3003d,inform
so if we ,fra,A,TS3003d,
Let's fir first count the buttons we have now .,sug,A,TS3003d,directive

"I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long .",sug,A,TS3003d,directive
Yep .,bck,C,TS3003d,feedback
That saves us uh one Euro already .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?,el.ass,A,TS3003d,

No . That wouldn't be an option .,oth,D,TS3003d,

but th it's not stated in this files .,inf,A,TS3003d,inform
It's just a .,fra,B,TS3003d,

Well,stl,D,TS3003d,
"I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .",sug,D,TS3003d,directive
That's possibility as well .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
That would cut the cost .,inf,D,TS3003d,inform
So ,stl,A,TS3003d,
And it's good for the design as well .,ass,A,TS3003d,feedback
So you can make ,fra,A,TS3003d,

but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty .,inf,A,TS3007b,inform

The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire .,inf,D,TS3007b,inform

I don't think that's uh really appropriate .,ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
"Um , and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies .",inf,D,TS3007b,inform
Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls .,inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly ,",inf,D,TS3007b,inform
uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .,inf,D,TS3007b,inform
So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer .,sug,D,TS3007b,directive

"Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants ,",ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear .,sug,D,TS3007b,directive
But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet .,ass,A,TS3007b,feedback
"Yeah , okay .",ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
So that that's strange .,ass,A,TS3007b,feedback

I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project .,off,C,TS3007b,commissive
Well uh,stl,C,TS3007b,
what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"and um I viewed how how they w looked ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"how they worked ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"uh what kind of components are involved ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and how they are connected together .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds .,off,C,TS3007b,commissive
And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works,off,C,TS3007b,commissive
and how we could uh build one,off,C,TS3007b,commissive
and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off .,off,C,TS3007b,commissive
Um right . Uh well,stl,C,TS3007b,
what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
not like all probably know .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a TV or uh a stereo or something ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and those uh have a transmitter,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"that's also focused on infrared ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the TV should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
so that would mean extra cost for the user,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and thus uh that's,fra,C,TS3007b,
that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us .,ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
So that's probably why most controls are still infrared .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
so that would probably uh mean lower costs,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and uh,stl,C,TS3007b,
i,fra,C,TS3007b,
that could mean for us a good thing,ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
Well uh,stl,C,TS3007b,
"as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth ",fra,C,TS3007b,
Well,stl,C,TS3007b,
"it may be possible ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
"but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
"but that's not for me to decide ,",off,C,TS3007b,commissive
but that's maybe something for marketing to look into .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
F,fra,C,TS3007b,
"because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves ,",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
although ,fra,C,TS3007b,
"What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the TV , connected to the TV ?",el.ass,D,TS3007b,
"Yeah ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
actually I have t,fra,C,TS3007b,
So it's in the wrong product .,inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"Yeah . Yeah ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
"I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
"but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote .",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something ,",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
"I dunno ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
"maybe uh maybe something to look into ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
But it may be uh may be something to explore .,ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components .,off,C,TS3007b,commissive
Uh first you have the energy source .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
uh that you can find anywhere .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"I figured that would be best ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch ,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
there is a switch uh between these .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
When the switch is pressed in a w on this,fra,C,TS3007b,
"this case it switches a button ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
displaying to the user that something has happened .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh .",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
Or I press button,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"but nothing's happening on the TV ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
so is is something wrong or something .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
Uh w well,stl,C,TS3007b,
the signal goes via chip,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and then it's processed,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and then it's sent to the infrared bulb,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television .",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
Uh well,stl,C,TS3007b,
"my personal preferences here ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
well,stl,C,TS3007b,
"we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions ,",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
just like you said,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
uh well,stl,C,TS3007b,
the most users n,fra,C,TS3007b,
uh you have a lot of buttons,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"and you u u use you don't use them ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
So uh,stl,C,TS3007b,
no input from the television .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
So,stl,C,TS3007b,
"I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that ,",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
and so,stl,C,TS3007b,
in order to receive the signals from uh what's on TV and such .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
So,stl,C,TS3007b,
I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time,ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
and ,fra,C,TS3007b,
"Um , yeah ,",stl,D,TS3007b,
"maybe another problem uh ,",ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
I think current TVs can even send infrared .,inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"Yes ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
but what should we uh s I I I f,fra,C,TS3007b,
"I agree with you ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ?,el.ass,C,TS3007b,
Huh .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
"Cause that would be I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control .",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"Um , well",stl,C,TS3007b,
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
we should uh look into the design and the functionability .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions ,",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
or well uh,stl,C,TS3007b,
"just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff .",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"And uh don't overbuild ,",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions ,",sug,C,TS3007b,directive
but we we should stick to the basics .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
So that was my uh my personal opinion .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
And that was my uh my presentation uh ,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
Okay .,und,B,TS3007b,feedback
"Okay ,",und,A,TS3007b,feedback
thank you Janus .,be.pos,A,TS3007b,
"Yes ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
I can go ahead .,off,B,TS3007b,commissive
You do ?,und,A,TS3007b,feedback
The last presentation .,inf,A,TS3007b,inform
Last presentation . Okay .,und,B,TS3007b,feedback
"You have plenty of time ,",inf,A,TS3007b,inform
"Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes ,",inf,A,TS3007b,inform
so uh,stl,A,TS3007b,
take your time .,sug,A,TS3007b,directive
If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh,off,A,TS3007b,commissive
warn you .,off,A,TS3007b,commissive
"Well ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions .,off,B,TS3007b,commissive
"Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one ,",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness ,",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
so tha that's that's some of the main points .,inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult ,",ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
so use as as little functions as possible,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
Hmm .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
"cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . ,inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen ,",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"but s I don't know in how far that is possible ,",ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
Hmm .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
since we are sticking to uh um infrared,inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"and and the remote cannot receive anything ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
but uh we might uh consider that .,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
"Um well ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
of course I I hope this is all clear to you .,el.und,B,TS3007b,
If you ,fra,B,TS3007b,
"you can use remote like this with all the functions ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"many functions ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"but Well ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this .,inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"You have to be very careful what you push ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour,inf,B,TS3007b,inform
from,fra,B,TS3007b,
"uh um yeah well ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
where is it ? Where the hell ,el.inf,B,TS3007b,
he here I guess,inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else .",fra,B,TS3007b,
"So just keep it simple ,",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"make clear buttons , easy to use .",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"For example if you want to use a play and back and stop ,",ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
that's very important .,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
Um well,stl,B,TS3007b,
"this was because of our last discussion ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines ,",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
but um it's no longer uh applying .,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
"Well yeah ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
I prefer to use it only for TV,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
and um n uh,stl,B,TS3007b,
not to give too many options,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"and and if possible , uh the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select ",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Uh,stl,A,TS3007b,
"you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one ,",inf,A,TS3007b,inform
"Yeah ,",ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
so uh,stl,A,TS3007b,
and so that's where the difficulties lie .,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
"Yeah ,",stl,C,TS3007b,
"you you want to keep it simple ,",inf,A,TS3007b,inform
but ,fra,C,TS3007b,
"but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one .",ass,A,TS3007b,feedback
"Yeah ,",ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
"Yeah . Yeah ,",ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
this ,fra,B,TS3007b,
so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
but ,fra,C,TS3007b,
"Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought ,",el.ass,B,TS3007b,
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,TS3007b,feedback
Okay .,bck,A,TS3007b,feedback
or do we want to use um many buttons .,el.ass,B,TS3007b,
Yeah .,bck,A,TS3007b,feedback
So um,stl,B,TS3007b,
weighing those factors .,fra,B,TS3007b,
Hmm ,stl,D,TS3007b,
"it's maybe an option uh if you use an LCD or a touch screen um ,",sug,D,TS3007b,directive
"that in the middle are the the main keys ,",sug,D,TS3007b,directive
like displayed on the ,fra,D,TS3007b,
Uh yeah .,oth,D,TS3007b,
The doesn't .,fra,B,TS3007b,
"Yeah , this ?",und,D,TS3007b,feedback
No ?,und,D,TS3007b,feedback
Yeah . Something like that .,inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"Okay ,",stl,D,TS3007b,
"just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching ,",sug,D,TS3007b,directive
Yeah .,bck,B,TS3007b,feedback
"and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down .",sug,D,TS3007b,directive
"Yeah ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
but when all the questions I had ,fra,B,TS3007b,
Do we want to use uh a menu display on the TV ?,el.ass,B,TS3007b,
Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ?,el.ass,B,TS3007b,
"Cause if you use a memory display on the TV , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay .",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
Mm .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
Uh so,stl,B,TS3007b,
"that's my recommendation ,",ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
Nah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
"if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the TV",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
"and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds ,",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
is too complicated for most users .,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
"I think so too ,",ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
"Yeah ,",stl,C,TS3007b,
but ,fra,C,TS3007b,
but ,fra,D,TS3007b,
"and that's partly because um uh a lot of TVs have different menus ,",inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on TV .",inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"Yeah , that will be a problem .",ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
Yeah .,ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
Well,stl,C,TS3007b,
"you d you have to keep in mind that uh several TVs uh don't even have a menu structure ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
"or they have a very simple menu structure ,",inf,C,TS3007b,inform
so,stl,C,TS3007b,
you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not ,fra,C,TS3007b,
our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .,inf,C,TS3007b,inform
Yes .,bck,B,TS3007b,feedback
And that would be uh a considerable problem .,ass,C,TS3007b,feedback
So,stl,B,TS3007b,
"if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this .",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Yeah .,bck,C,TS3007b,feedback
Use big clear buttons . Not too many .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
but I think i this is more important . Um,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
"especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Not embed,fra,C,TS3007b,
"Yeah ,",stl,C,TS3007b,
but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something .,sug,C,TS3007b,directive
"And yeah ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
"if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do .",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Not first change menu options or switch something .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Yeah .,bck,C,TS3007b,feedback
"Um , well yeah ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
"as you already told , give some feedback .",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Yeah .,bck,C,TS3007b,feedback
If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"And um , well ,",stl,B,TS3007b,
"my conclusion is uh is uh less is more ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
keep it simple .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
So uh,stl,B,TS3007b,
maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
on t,fra,B,TS3007b,
"because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
some you you'll never know,inf,B,TS3007b,inform
"uh and never use ,",inf,B,TS3007b,inform
and therefore it's uh important,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"Yeah . Uh ,",stl,D,TS3007b,
I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good .,ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
"Um , because recently uh I saw news item on TV um about uh new telephones uh for elder people .",inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up ,",inf,D,TS3007b,inform
"um and that's a big ad advantage I think ,",ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something .,sug,D,TS3007b,directive
Mm-hmm .,bck,A,TS3007b,feedback
It's uh,inf,D,TS3007b,inform
very visual intended .,inf,D,TS3007b,inform
What was I to say more ?,off,D,TS3007b,commissive
Maybe that's an option .,ass,B,TS3007b,feedback
Um keep the primary buttons visible .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
Yeah .,bck,D,TS3007b,feedback
Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form .,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"and maybe use a touch screen ,",sug,B,TS3007b,directive
or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um ,sug,B,TS3007b,directive
"Yeah okay ,",ass,D,TS3007b,feedback
"but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea",inf,D,TS3007b,inform

then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?,el.inf,D,TS3007b,

"Yeah ,",stl,D,TS3007b,

Oh .,oth,A,TS3007c,
"Well , we could also use a battery ,",inf,C,TS3007c,inform
that's a bit ,fra,C,TS3007c,

"Yeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .",inf,C,TS3007c,inform
"Uh , and uh uh ",fra,D,TS3007c,
And then then it d then it has some more uh energy .,inf,C,TS3007c,inform
"Well , y you could just go for a battery .",inf,C,TS3007c,inform
Hmm .,bck,D,TS3007c,feedback
Or you can go for both ?,inf,C,TS3007c,inform
"Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?",el.inf,B,TS3007c,

and uh it has some ar artistic meaning .,inf,B,TS3007d,inform
No ?,be.neg,B,TS3007d,
This uh isn't nothing . ,inf,B,TS3007d,inform
Idea maybe uh is better .,ass,B,TS3007d,feedback
"Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb ,",inf,B,TS3007d,inform
"and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand ,",inf,B,TS3007d,inform
so it's just gonna hold it easily .,inf,B,TS3007d,inform
"And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course .",inf,B,TS3007d,inform
So we began uh working out a concept .,inf,B,TS3007d,inform
"Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel LCD uh screen .",inf,C,TS3007d,inform
"Well , these would be the main buttons ,",inf,C,TS3007d,inform
h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform

We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform
We have the sub-menus and stu stuff .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform

"Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on ",off,C,TS3007d,commissive
you have more b a better idea after that .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform
"But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two .",inf,C,TS3007d,inform
Hmm .,bck,D,TS3007d,feedback
"And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down .",inf,C,TS3007d,inform
It won't uh roll around or stuff .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform

or like these old uh phones .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform
Mm .,bck,A,TS3007d,feedback
Y you you may get the idea .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform
So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform
"The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers ,",inf,C,TS3007d,inform
like we discussed early on .,inf,C,TS3007d,inform

"And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics",inf,C,TS3007d,inform

"So , you have room here for your battery",inf,B,TS3007d,inform
and maybe even other um electronic chips .,inf,B,TS3007d,inform
S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip .,inf,B,TS3007d,inform
