"hi , george . i'm going to have a job interview next week . could you give me some advice ?",directive,no emotion,64,sp0,directive
"sure . first of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .",directive,no emotion,64,sp1,directive
"yeah , that's very important .",commissive,no emotion,64,sp0,commissive
"so you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .",directive,no emotion,64,sp1,directive
i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .,commissive,no emotion,64,sp0,commissive
"that ’ s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .",directive,no emotion,64,sp1,directive
it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .,commissive,no emotion,64,sp0,commissive
"it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .",directive,no emotion,64,sp1,directive
but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans .,commissive,no emotion,64,sp0,commissive
"i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .",directive,no emotion,64,sp1,directive
it ’ s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes .,commissive,no emotion,64,sp0,commissive
"you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .",directive,no emotion,64,sp1,directive
i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time .,commissive,no emotion,64,sp0,commissive
you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .,directive,no emotion,64,sp1,directive
it seems that ' clothes make the man ' .,commissive,no emotion,64,sp0,commissive
