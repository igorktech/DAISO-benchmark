g|okay|align|q1nc4
f|uh-huh|reply_y|q1nc4
g|about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're|clarify|q1nc4

g|okay|align|q1nc4
f|right|reply_y|q1nc4
f|right up over the pine|check|q1nc4
g|over the pine|reply_y|q1nc4

f|erm about an inch and a half|reply_w|q1nc4
g|yeah well|ready|q1nc4
g|don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest|clarify|q1nc4
f|uh-huh|acknowledge|q1nc4
f|okay|acknowledge|q1nc4

g|you have right|check|q1nc4
f|mmhmm|reply_y|q1nc4
g|well|ready|q1nc4
g|just draw the arc and stop the arc you know in line with the wheatfields but beneath the pine forest|instruct|q1nc4
g|okay|align|q1nc4
f|i|reply_y|q1nc4
f|don't understand|reply_n|q1nc4
f|say that again|instruct|q1nc4
g|oh two or three inches down from the pine forest|clarify|q1nc4
g|okay you know|align|q1nc4
g|it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields|clarify|q1nc4
g|okay|align|q1nc4
g|but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there|clarify|q1nc4
g|above the bakery in other words above the eh|clarify|q1nc4
f|where is your wheatfields|query_w|q1nc4
g|well er you know|ready|q1nc4
g|imagine where the forge would be on your map or it's it's on mine but imagine where it would be|instruct|q1nc4

g|no no no|reply_n|q1nc4
f|no|check|q1nc4
g|no|reply_n|q1nc4
g|don't worry about the wheatfields it's just to tell you where to stop the line|clarify|q1nc4
f|right okay|acknowledge|q1nc4
g|never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anything|clarify|q1nc4
f|okay|acknowledge|q1nc4
g|just just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest|instruct|q1nc4
f|right|acknowledge|q1nc4
g|okay|align|q1nc4
g|and once you get to the where it says pine draw a line from there to eh above the bakery but not the chimney a bit to the left of that in fact the left-hand side it must be a wee shed or whatever it is|instruct|q1nc4
f|right|ready|q1nc4
g|you see what i|align|q1nc4
f|and i'm going am i going straight down|check|q1nc4

f|mmhmm|acknowledge|q1nc4
g|eh take your line down to crane bay|instruct|q1nc4
g|oh i've got two wheatfields that's not important is it right anyway|explain|q1nc4
g|so you get to the canal right you don't have one but just go down about two inches until you get to crane bay and follow follow the curve|instruct|q1nc4
g|okay|align|q1nc4

g|or the where the "c" is|align|q1nc4
f|uh-huh|reply_y|q1nc4
g|i've got wheatfields in line with where it says bay okay about an inch or so to the left of crane bay itself just in line in fact beneath where the other wheatfields were that i that i was telling you about|explain|q1nc4
f|mmhmm|acknowledge|q1nc4
f|right okay|acknowledge|q1nc4
g|okay|ready|q1nc4
g|so you go round the round that curve and you have to go down and about an inch and a half|instruct|q1nc4

g|yeah|acknowledge|q2ec4
g|you're going to actually go through the rift valley|instruct|q2ec4
g|like the rift valley's like a half moon|align|q2ec4
f|yeah|reply_y|q2ec4
g|you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley|instruct|q2ec4

f|go through the centre|check|q2ec4
f|i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah|acknowledge|q2ec4
g|yeah|reply_y|q2ec4

f|right okay|acknowledge|q2ec4
f|erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up|query_yn|q2ec4
g|yeah below|reply_y|q2ec4
g|and then like into the rift valley|clarify|q2ec4
f|okay right|ready|q2ec4
g|and right through|reply_y|q2ec4
f|i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour|explain|q2ec4
f|right|ready|q2ec4
f|and just take it straight through towards the top of the page|check|q2ec4
g|straight through yeah|reply_y|q2ec4
f|alright there we go|acknowledge|q2ec4
g|and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way|clarify|q2ec4
g|do you know what i mean|align|q2ec4
f|not quite|reply_n|q2ec4
g|right|ready|q2ec4
g|you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right|align|q2ec4
f|was i|query_w|q2ec4
g|yeah|reply_y|q2ec4
g|above the rift valley|clarify|q2ec4
g|you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint|instruct|q2ec4
f|right|acknowledge|q2ec4
f|mm that's not where i am now|explain|q2ec4
f|right so where hang on right so|query_w|q2ec4

f|mm aye directly above the noose that's a better description|reply_y|q2ec4
g|okay|acknowledge|q2ec4
g|from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit|instruct|q2ec4
