A,Now that's an idea.,ba,feedback
A,"don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,",ad,directive

B,Right.,b,feedback
A,And that's .,%,
B,"But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,",sd,inform

B,"patent it,",sd,inform
B,that's a good idea.,sv,inform
A,If you could come up with a device that's the thing.,sv,inform
