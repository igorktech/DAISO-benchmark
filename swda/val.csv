A,"as far as I'm concerned, I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating,",sv,inform

B,in some ways they're for the better,sv,inform
B,"because I think women should have a choice,",sv,inform
B,"and I do believe in the, being able to have a choice as to, as far as, what you would like to do with your life.",sv,inform
B,"But by the same token, and I know this for myself because I've worked and I've not worked, um,",sd,inform
B,"that it makes it, uh, sometimes it makes life more difficult.",sv,inform
B,"I think when the roles now are less defined, as far as, you know, what, uh, women should or should not be doing, that it, it, it could make life more difficult.",sv,inform
B,There are more things to work out.,sv,inform
B,"I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,",sv,inform
B,so you have added stresses from there,sv,inform
B,"and then you still have all the things that, um, that you need to do at home",sv,inform
B,"and that doesn't change, you know,",sv,inform
B,"just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away",sv,inform
B,and the other responsibilities are still important.,sv,inform
B,"Um,",%,

B,Yes.,b,feedback
A,"I was a school teacher,",sd,inform
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.,sd,inform
B,Uh-huh,b,feedback
A,"Uh, we,",%,

A,"and I stayed home with those children, and raised those children",sd,inform
B,Yes.,b,feedback
A,"and now that my husband has retired, I am back substitute teaching,",sd,inform

A,"Uh, I'm, I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply.",sv,inform
A,I think they're going in by choice.,sv,inform
B,"Oh, I think so.",aa,agreement
B,Yes.,aa,agreement
A,Yes.,b^m,feedback
A,"And, and I have no problem with that,",sv,inform
A,but I think the male needs to be the dominant person.,sv,inform
A,"And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh, are not letting that happen.",sv,inform
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,They are very aggressive.,sv,inform
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,"They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer killer bee instinct.",sv,inform

B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,"Children Well, what do you think, ater running",qw,setq
B,"though, um, um,",%,
B,I don't know.,h,answer
B,"I,",%,
B,"the, the one problem I guess I have,",sv,inform
B,"and maybe what so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is,",sv,inform
B,"I feel that in general, in this society, that being at home is not looked upon as, um, a job in itself.",sv,inform
B,"Whereas, you know, you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself,",sd,inform
B,"but I know when I was working,",sd,inform
B,"and I was an engineer so I was always with men,",sd,inform
B,"uh, and they were single, many of them,",sd,inform
B,"and I tried to explain to them, well, my day doesn't end when I leave at,",sd,inform
B,"I used to leave at three, I keep going to eleven at night",sd,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,"and they had, they used to look down on women that were home,",sd,inform

B,"you know, at least you get out of here at three",^q,
B,"and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas,",^q,
A,"Oh, sure <laughter>.",b,feedback
B,"and I used to be infuriated,",sd,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home.,sd,inform
B,"Now taking care of them, running them everywhere, helping with homework, the bath, the whole, you know, everything.",sd,inform
B,"Um, and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected, and that being home is not a respectable, uh, position in society.",sv,inform
A,Huh.,b,feedback
B,"And, there's a lot of truth to that",sv,inform
B,and I don't know how you feel.,sd,inform
B,"I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got,",sd,inform
B,but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home.,sv,inform
B,"And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,",sv,inform
B,"you, you,",%,
B,"once in a while, you hear them say things like, I wish I had the choice, you know.",sd,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,"I wish I was the one,",^q,
B,"I would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us,",^q,
A,"If my wife had an education and could support us,",^2,
A,"and the only value I see coming out of, this is that children now in, in a two parent home, they now actually have two parents,",sv,inform
B,<Children> Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,Yeah.,b,feedback
A,"because I see my sons-in-law,",sd,inform
A,I have a daughter who's a nurse,sd,inform
A,"and I have a daughter, who's a beautician.",sd,inform
B,Right.,b,feedback
A,"And I see, my sons-in-law cooking and, dropping children off at the sitter and, picking children up from school and, and having a much better relationship with their children, than my husband ever did",sd,inform

B,Right.,b,feedback
B,Right <noise>.,b,feedback
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,That's true.,sv,inform
A,"because he, left home at five thirty in the morning,",sd,inform
B,That's true.,sv,inform
A,and he got home at six fifteen.,sd,inform
B,Yes.,b,feedback
A,"And, uh, he ate his dinner",sd,inform
A,and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted.,sd,inform
B,Right.,b,feedback
A,"So, now the young fathers are having a chance to parent,",sv,inform
A,"and I think, that's an advantage.",sv,inform
B,And they enjoy it.,^2,
B,Yeah.,aa,agreement
B,And they do enjoy it.,sv,inform
B,"I, I see,",sd,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,you're right.,aa,agreement
B,"I see many more men in the supermarket, in the parks with their children,",sd,inform
A,"Uh-huh,",b,feedback
A,uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,and I think that is healthy because,sv,inform
A,"And I think it's a, a wonderful advantage for the young, for the, for the, particularly for the males, for the little boys to have, a relationship with their father,",sv,inform
B,Right.,aa,agreement
B,"Oh, yeah.",aa,agreement
A,"and, and I don't, think you, we get into so much of the mother dominating figure, if, if the father has more input there.",sv,inform
B,Yes.,aa,agreement
B,Yeah.,b,feedback
A,"But, uh, I don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads,",sv,inform
A,"and they have to, that kind of job, uh, to go out there and shovel that tar and, and drive those big trucks.",sd,inform
A,"And we just recently finished a long drive through the west, a little over five thousand miles,",sd,inform
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,"and at one point we sat down, uh,",sd,inform
A,"I didn't realize it,",sd,inform
A,but I sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only.,sd,inform
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,And here's this young girl with the tattoos,sd,inform
A,"and she has just, had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona,",sd,inform
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,"and she'd been,",sd,inform
A,and I ask her how old she was,sd,inform
A,and she was the between the age of our daughters,sd,inform
A,"and she had been driving, a truck for seven years.",sd,inform
B,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,"And I thought, gosh,",sd,inform
A,"I mean, why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when,",sv,inform
B,Yeah.,b,feedback
A,I guess I'm I'm maybe Victorian,sv,inform
A,"and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist,",sv,inform
A,"in that, he's a very considerate person,",sv,inform
A,"but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and, and in the home,",sd,inform
A,"and she should vote,",sd,inform
A,but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote.,sd,inform
B,"Oh, boy <laughter>.",ba,feedback
A,"Now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because I have strong opinions about things, too,",sd,inform
B,Yeah.,b,feedback
A,"but, uh, I like being taken care of.",sd,inform
A,"I like my luggage, carried and, my door opened,",sd,inform
B,"Well,",h,answer
A,and I think the young women are losing that,sv,inform
A,and I think that's sad.,sv,inform
B,"well, that, that's true.",aa,agreement
B,"There is that part, too,",sv,inform
B,and I guess we also have to examine though,sv,inform
B,"and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as, you know, anybody else,",sv,inform
A,"He was raised in the south,",sd,inform
B,"um,",b,feedback
A,"I think that's a little condition,",sv,inform
B,"I guess ha-,",%,
A,both.,%,
B,"Oh, oh, yeah.",b,feedback
B,"And, and you have to, I guess you have to question too, why a lot of the men, especially, I think middle age and older men, why they feel that way",sv,inform
B,"and, and I think it gets scary for them to see change, also.",sv,inform
B,"They've been used to being, really to be honest, in, in society, and in a way, number one,",sv,inform
B,and they come home,sd,inform
B,and everything's done for them.,sd,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,Huh.,b,feedback
B,And their meal is served,sd,inform
B,and I think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching.,sv,inform
A,Sure.,aa,agreement
B,"And I think, I think this reaction comes more out of fear.",sv,inform
B,"Now, my husband is, um, he's ten years older than me,",sd,inform
B,"and,",%,
B,"but he has, his attitudes are very much pro-women, pro-career, which is kind of interesting.",sv,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,"He comes from a culture where women are, stay at home and do everything,",sd,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,"um, and yet, um, he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility, um, if that meant, oor you know, for me to be able to, uh, uh, advance or go back to work or whatever.",sd,inform
B,"I'm kind of more,",sd,inform
B,"alking to someone in background, thank you, esumes talking to speaker A",t3,
B,I'm kind of more middle of the road.,sd,inform
B,"I think that when children are small, I think it's okay for women to work especially,",sv,inform
B,"there should be some, a lot more part time,",sv,inform
B,"but I think it's, um,",sv,inform
B,"I don't believe in this career, you know, this career drive when, when they're small, because I think,",sv,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,"alking to someone in background, they're downstairs esumes talking to A",t3,
B,"I think that's very, um, unfair to, to children,",sv,inform
B,"like, uh, engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week,",sd,inform
A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
A,Huh.,b,feedback
A,Huh.,b,feedback

A,Uh-huh.,b,feedback
B,I was part-time,sd,inform
B,"and even that was a rat race,",sv,inform
A,Huh.,b,feedback

B,"I didn't want, I don't want a job where I'm traveling around and I'm away and, uh,",sd,inform
B,so I think you can have both.,sv,inform
B,"It's more hectic,",sv,inform
B,"but I think you have to put into perspective what your kids need, first then",sv,inform
A,"I think a lot of, my problem with the young mothers ...",sv,inform
