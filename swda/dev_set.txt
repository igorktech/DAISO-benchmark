B|Um, all right.|o_"_bc|2347
A|I've, uh,|%|2347
A|as far as I'm concerned, I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating,|sv|2347
A|and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now.|sv|2347
B|Uh-huh.|aa|2347
B|Oh, well, I tend, I tend to agree.|aa|2347
B|Uh, in some ways I think it's, uh, I think if anything, a lot of, um, the changes that have occurred, uh,|sv|2347
B|in some ways they're for the better|sv|2347
B|because I think women should have a choice,|sv|2347
B|and I do believe in the, being able to have a choice as to, as far as, what you would like to do with your life.|sv|2347
B|But by the same token, and I know this for myself because I've worked and I've not worked, um,|sd|2347
B|that it makes it, uh, sometimes it makes life more difficult.|sv|2347
B|I think when the roles now are less defined, as far as, you know, what, uh, women should or should not be doing, that it, it, it could make life more difficult.|sv|2347
B|There are more things to work out.|sv|2347
B|I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,|sv|2347
B|so you have added stresses from there|sv|2347
B|and then you still have all the things that, um, that you need to do at home|sv|2347
B|and that doesn't change, you know,|sv|2347
B|just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away|sv|2347
B|and the other responsibilities are still important.|sv|2347
B|Um,|%|2347
B|so, um, have you, have you worked outside, also and, um, feel that, it, that,|qy|2347
B|well, how do you feel, as far as, uh,|qo|2347
B|what would be a happy medium|qw|2347
B|or, or what would you like to see?|qo|2347
A|I would like, uh,|sv|2347
A|yes,|ny|2347
A|I have worked outside of the home|sd|2347
A|and, I was in one of those safe occupations.|sd|2347
B|Yes.|b|2347
A|I was a school teacher,|sd|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.|sd|2347
B|Uh-huh|b|2347
A|Uh, we,|%|2347
A|uh, then I stopped teaching after my husband's business was established,|sd|2347
A|and we had two children|sd|2347
A|and I stayed home with those children, and raised those children|sd|2347
B|Yes.|b|2347
A|and now that my husband has retired, I am back substitute teaching,|sd|2347
B|Yes.|b|2347
A|which if anyone has ever been involved in that, some days it's fun|sv|2347
A|and some days you wonder why you're even bothering,|sv|2347
B|Right|b|2347
A|because your fighting for your life.|sv|2347
B|But,|%|2347
B|yeah.|b|2347
A|But, I am a fighter|sd|2347
A|and I've always been a disciplinarian.|sd|2347
A|Uh, I'm, I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply.|sv|2347
A|I think they're going in by choice.|sv|2347
B|Oh, I think so.|aa|2347
B|Yes.|aa|2347
A|Yes.|b^m|2347
A|And, and I have no problem with that,|sv|2347
A|but I think the male needs to be the dominant person.|sv|2347
A|And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh, are not letting that happen.|sv|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|They are very aggressive.|sv|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer killer bee instinct.|sv|2347
B|Yeah.|b|2347
A|And they have to be in charge.|sv|2347
A|And, and I I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands.|sv|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|Children Well, what do you think, ater running|qw|2347
B|though, um, um,|%|2347
B|I don't know.|h|2347
B|I,|%|2347
B|the, the one problem I guess I have,|sv|2347
B|and maybe what so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is,|sv|2347
B|I feel that in general, in this society, that being at home is not looked upon as, um, a job in itself.|sv|2347
B|Whereas, you know, you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself,|sd|2347
B|but I know when I was working,|sd|2347
B|and I was an engineer so I was always with men,|sd|2347
B|uh, and they were single, many of them,|sd|2347
B|and I tried to explain to them, well, my day doesn't end when I leave at,|sd|2347
B|I used to leave at three, I keep going to eleven at night|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|and they had, they used to look down on women that were home,|sd|2347
B|they'd say, oh, I bet you go home and,|sd|2347
B|you know, at least you get out of here at three|^q|2347
B|and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas,|^q|2347
A|Oh, sure <laughter>.|b|2347
B|and I used to be infuriated,|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home.|sd|2347
B|Now taking care of them, running them everywhere, helping with homework, the bath, the whole, you know, everything.|sd|2347
B|Um, and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected, and that being home is not a respectable, uh, position in society.|sv|2347
A|Huh.|b|2347
B|And, there's a lot of truth to that|sv|2347
B|and I don't know how you feel.|sd|2347
B|I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got,|sd|2347
B|but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home.|sv|2347
B|And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,|sv|2347
B|you, you,|%|2347
B|once in a while, you hear them say things like, I wish I had the choice, you know.|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|I wish I was the one,|^q|2347
B|I would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us,|^q|2347
A|If my wife had an education and could support us,|^2|2347
A|and the only value I see coming out of, this is that children now in, in a two parent home, they now actually have two parents,|sv|2347
B|<Children> Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|Yeah.|b|2347
A|because I see my sons-in-law,|sd|2347
A|I have a daughter who's a nurse|sd|2347
A|and I have a daughter, who's a beautician.|sd|2347
B|Right.|b|2347
A|And I see, my sons-in-law cooking and, dropping children off at the sitter and, picking children up from school and, and having a much better relationship with their children, than my husband ever did|sd|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|Right.|b|2347
B|Right.|b|2347
B|Right <noise>.|b|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|That's true.|sv|2347
A|because he, left home at five thirty in the morning,|sd|2347
B|That's true.|sv|2347
A|and he got home at six fifteen.|sd|2347
B|Yes.|b|2347
A|And, uh, he ate his dinner|sd|2347
A|and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted.|sd|2347
B|Right.|b|2347
A|So, now the young fathers are having a chance to parent,|sv|2347
A|and I think, that's an advantage.|sv|2347
B|And they enjoy it.|^2|2347
B|Yeah.|aa|2347
B|And they do enjoy it.|sv|2347
B|I, I see,|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|you're right.|aa|2347
B|I see many more men in the supermarket, in the parks with their children,|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh,|b|2347
A|uh-huh.|b|2347
B|and I think that is healthy because|sv|2347
A|And I think it's a, a wonderful advantage for the young, for the, for the, particularly for the males, for the little boys to have, a relationship with their father,|sv|2347
B|Right.|aa|2347
B|Oh, yeah.|aa|2347
A|and, and I don't, think you, we get into so much of the mother dominating figure, if, if the father has more input there.|sv|2347
B|Yes.|aa|2347
B|Yeah.|b|2347
A|But, uh, I don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads,|sv|2347
A|and they have to, that kind of job, uh, to go out there and shovel that tar and, and drive those big trucks.|sd|2347
A|And we just recently finished a long drive through the west, a little over five thousand miles,|sd|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|and at one point we sat down, uh,|sd|2347
A|I didn't realize it,|sd|2347
A|but I sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only.|sd|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|And here's this young girl with the tattoos|sd|2347
A|and she has just, had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona,|sd|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|and she'd been,|sd|2347
A|and I ask her how old she was|sd|2347
A|and she was the between the age of our daughters|sd|2347
A|and she had been driving, a truck for seven years.|sd|2347
B|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|And I thought, gosh,|sd|2347
A|I mean, why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when,|sv|2347
B|Yeah.|b|2347
A|I guess I'm I'm maybe Victorian|sv|2347
A|and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist,|sv|2347
A|in that, he's a very considerate person,|sv|2347
A|but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and, and in the home,|sd|2347
A|and she should vote,|sd|2347
A|but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote.|sd|2347
B|Oh, boy <laughter>.|ba|2347
A|Now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because I have strong opinions about things, too,|sd|2347
B|Yeah.|b|2347
A|but, uh, I like being taken care of.|sd|2347
A|I like my luggage, carried and, my door opened,|sd|2347
B|Well,|h|2347
A|and I think the young women are losing that|sv|2347
A|and I think that's sad.|sv|2347
B|well, that, that's true.|aa|2347
B|There is that part, too,|sv|2347
B|and I guess we also have to examine though|sv|2347
B|and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as, you know, anybody else,|sv|2347
A|He was raised in the south,|sd|2347
B|um,|b|2347
A|I think that's a little condition,|sv|2347
B|I guess ha-,|%|2347
A|both.|%|2347
B|Oh, oh, yeah.|b|2347
B|And, and you have to, I guess you have to question too, why a lot of the men, especially, I think middle age and older men, why they feel that way|sv|2347
B|and, and I think it gets scary for them to see change, also.|sv|2347
B|They've been used to being, really to be honest, in, in society, and in a way, number one,|sv|2347
B|and they come home|sd|2347
B|and everything's done for them.|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|Huh.|b|2347
B|And their meal is served|sd|2347
B|and I think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching.|sv|2347
A|Sure.|aa|2347
B|And I think, I think this reaction comes more out of fear.|sv|2347
B|Now, my husband is, um, he's ten years older than me,|sd|2347
B|and,|%|2347
B|but he has, his attitudes are very much pro-women, pro-career, which is kind of interesting.|sv|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|He comes from a culture where women are, stay at home and do everything,|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|um, and yet, um, he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility, um, if that meant, oor you know, for me to be able to, uh, uh, advance or go back to work or whatever.|sd|2347
B|I'm kind of more,|sd|2347
B|alking to someone in background, thank you, esumes talking to speaker A|t3|2347
B|I'm kind of more middle of the road.|sd|2347
B|I think that when children are small, I think it's okay for women to work especially,|sv|2347
B|there should be some, a lot more part time,|sv|2347
B|but I think it's, um,|sv|2347
B|I don't believe in this career, you know, this career drive when, when they're small, because I think,|sv|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|alking to someone in background, they're downstairs esumes talking to A|t3|2347
B|I think that's very, um, unfair to, to children,|sv|2347
B|like, uh, engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week,|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
A|Huh.|b|2347
A|Huh.|b|2347
B|I refused to work more than thirty.|sd|2347
A|Uh-huh.|b|2347
B|I was part-time|sd|2347
B|and even that was a rat race,|sv|2347
A|Huh.|b|2347
B|but I think you have to put in perspective, that, you know, when the kids came home from school, I wanted to be here.|sv|2347
B|I didn't want, I don't want a job where I'm traveling around and I'm away and, uh,|sd|2347
B|so I think you can have both.|sv|2347
B|It's more hectic,|sv|2347
B|but I think you have to put into perspective what your kids need, first then|sv|2347
A|I think a lot of, my problem with the young mothers ...|sv|2347
B|Talk about the activities that we don't do|o_"_bc|2505
A|Yeah.|b|2505
A|I, I don't have any children,|sd|2505
A|so,|%|2505
A|but I, I have a lot of friends with children|sd|2505
A|and I know they spend a lot of time with them.|sd|2505
A|Which is good, you know.|sv|2505
B|That's good to hear.|sv|2505
B|Yeah,|%|2505
B|an, I haven't, uh,|%|2505
B|well I've been around a lot of people lately at at my job that don't have a lot of values|sv|2505
B|So, it's, it's always nice to see people that like each other,|sv|2505
B|and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together.|sv|2505
A|Yeah,|b|2505
A|have a lot of values,|bf|2505
A|I love that.|sd|2505
A|Do they have children?|qy|2505
B|Uh, the one, the most valueless girl doesn't,|ng|2505
B|but she's married,|sd|2505
B|and I, I'm not quite sure why.|sv|2505
B|I, I think he said that he'd give her a big ring and she got married to him.|sv|2505
A|Oh, that's wonderful|ba|2505
B|But, it, it's kind of weighed on me|sd|2505
B|and then the other day my husband and I met a couple who, who,|sd|2505
B|they're just going to have their first child|sd|2505
B|and they really like each other.|sd|2505
B|And they're real happy with one another|sd|2505
B|and she says things like, I'm really glad when he comes home|sd|2505
B|and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening|^q|2505
B|and,|%|2505
A|Oh, that's neat.|ba|2505
B|I'm like, really.|sd|2505
A|That's good, you know,|sv|2505
A|I like to see that.|sd|2505
B|Yeah.|b|2505
A|You know, I have, uh, some friends that, uh,|sd|2505
A|first of all, uh, the girls joined,|sd|2505
A|they have two girls,|sd|2505
A|one joined the Girl Scouts|sd|2505
A|and the other was in the Brownies|sd|2505
A|and then the mother got involved as a leader|sd|2505
A|and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and working with the Girl Scout camp here in Dallas and then going out to, uh, Betty Perot camp and working with the horses and stuff|sd|2505
A|and they're gone a lot|sd|2505
A|and they take their girls|sd|2505
A|and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even, you know, to do work with the Girl Scouts|sd|2505
A|and I think it's neat.|sv|2505
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2505
A|You know, they've really become very much involved in, in just that one organization,|sd|2505
A|which the organization can use the help too.|sv|2505
B|Right.|b|2505
A|So, I, I wish I could see more of that, you know.|sd|2505
B|On Sunday we just met, uh, a family,|sd|2505
B|we were thinking about getting cat|sd|2505
B|and we went over to, uh, lady that breeds them here in town|sd|2505
B|and, uh, her daughter actually was,|sd|2505
B|she said that her husband said to her daughter, you need a hobby,|sd|2505
B|so, she chose the cats.|sd|2505
A|Oh.|b|2505
B|And you can tell, it's a family hobby.|sd|2505
B|they're all a part of it.|sd|2505
B|And it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and, and the cats|sv|2505
B|and they raise champion cats.|sd|2505
B|So, they've done really well.|sd|2505
A|Ugh,|b|2505
A|those are neat cats, too.|sv|2505
B|Yeah,|b|2505
B|I've just learned about that breed.|sd|2505
A|They're really nice looking cats.|sv|2505
A|I have seven cats|sd|2505
A|but they're all mongrels|sd|2505
B|Well that's what we're going to end up getting|sd|2505
A|Well they're the ones that need the homes.|sd|2505
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2505
A|You know, mine were just all, uh, strays in the neighborhood.|sd|2505
A|Little baby kittens dropped and stuff|sd|2505
A|and it just kind of built.|sd|2505
A|One at a time, just|sd|2505
A|I couldn't, you know.|sd|2505
A|One time two of them came at once|sd|2505
A|and I can't turn a hungry cat down.|sd|2505
B|Oh, I know.|ba|2505
A|So, you know,|%|2505
A|and the last one that I was here, uh,|sd|2505
A|the kids brought him over and said he was injured|sd|2505
A|and it was winter time|sd|2505
A|and I said, I just can not have another cat,|sd|2505
A|I just can not have another cat|^q|2505
A|and I looked out there|sd|2505
A|and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all,|sd|2505
B|Oh!|ba|2505
A|and I said, I can't stand it,|sd|2505
A|I brought him in so.|sd|2505
A|Those are my children.|sd|2505
A|We don't have very many activities|sd|2505
A|but,|%|2505
B|No,|b|2505
B|I know what you mean,|sd|2505
B|our cat hates other cats,|sd|2505
B|and, we've tried to get her to like other cats|sd|2505
B|and she just, uh, she wants to be around human beings|sd|2505
B|and she does not want to be around other cats.|sd|2505
B|So our next, uh,|%|2505
B|we're going to try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out.|sd|2505
A|Ha, ha, lots of luck.|sd|2505
A|Is she spayed.|qy|2505
B|Yeah.|ny|2505
A|Oh, yeah,|b^m|2505
A|real maternal|sv|2505
B|We're hoping,|sd|2505
B|it's our last hope|sd|2505
A|She'll eventually,|%|2505
A|I mean, mine, you know, I have five males and two females.|sd|2505
A|Everybody's spayed,|sd|2505
A|everybody's neutered|sd|2505
A|and we still have a scrap every now and then.|sd|2505
A|Nothing real bad, you know,|sd|2505
A|a slap here and there,|sd|2505
A|but, uh, they put up with each other|sd|2505
A|and they will eventually.|sd|2505
A|her nose will be out of joint for a while|sv|2505
A|and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then,|sv|2505
A|but they'll, she'll finally accept it.|sv|2505
A|You know, they really don't have any choice|sv|2505
B|They|%|2505
A|In my household, we have a little bit, of, uh, a fight for whose boss.|sd|2505
A|I mean a male cats are, are you know, real territorial|sd|2505
A|and so that's the big battle here, you know,|sd|2505
A|of whose, whose top dog, top cat, I guess.|sd|2505
B|Uh-huh.|b|2505
A|You know, but, uh,|%|2505
A|I I don't know,|h|2505
A|I don't have a problem with it.|sd|2505
A|I think they just learn to accept.|sv|2505
A|And I have two dogs too,|sd|2505
A|and they've slapped the dogs around too|sd|2505
B|Yeah,|b|2505
B|yeah.|b|2505
A|Every now and then,|sd|2505
A|so.|%|2505
B|That's true,|sv|2505
B|they've got to keep them in line.|sv|2505
A|Yeah|b|2505
A|but she'll accept another cat eventually.|sv|2505
A|As long as you make her feel, uh, like she's still loved and everything,|sv|2505
A|so.|%|2505
B|Yeah,|b|2505
B|well those cats were great.|sv|2505
B|They were fourteen pounds and,|sd|2505
A|And|%|2505
B|oh, they're just gorgeous,|sv|2505
B|but, yeah,|%|2505
B|it,|%|2505
B|three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten.|sd|2505
A|Oh my gosh|ba|2505
B|And I think of those,|sd|2505
B|I think of the kittens at the pound.|sd|2505
A|Yeah.|b|2505
A|Three hundred and fifty dollars hispers.|bf|2505
B|Yeah,|aa|2505
B|yeah,|aa|2505
B|and they are lovely|sv|2505
B|but,|%|2505
A|till whispering Ugh,|ba|2505
A|house payment|sv|2505
B|Right.|aa|2505
A|That is a lot of money.|sv|2505
B|Yeah,|aa|2505
B|and then she's saying, you know, you can't let them outside|sd|2505
B|and you can't do all this stuff|^q|2505
B|and I'm like, ugh, you know.|sd|2505
A|I don't let mine out anyway,|sd|2505
A|but.|%|2505
A|I let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then,|sd|2505
A|but my cats are|sd|2505
A|I'm afraid, you know, the neighbors will,|sd|2505
A|people throw rocks at them,|sd|2505
A|and people run over them|sd|2505
A|and, I, I just, you know, I just don't.|sd|2505
A|I know|%|2505
A|and, and now they've lost the desire.|sd|2505
A|Most of them don't even try to you know, to go out.|sd|2505
A|I just have two that drive me crazy, that I let out in the back, you know,|sd|2505
A|but I won't let them get,|sd|2505
A|if they start going in the front and stuff, I bring them in.|sd|2505
B|Oh.|b|2505
A|You know, I just worry,|sd|2505
A|I guess I'm too protective,|sv|2505
A|but, you know.|%|2505
A|I see these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood|sd|2505
A|and too they can catch diseases really easy,|sd|2505
B|Yeah,|b|2505
B|yeah.|b|2505
A|just by touching a nose to another cat they can leukemia, feline leukemia,|sd|2505
A|so.|%|2505
B|Yeah.|b|2505
A|We know we try, try real hard to keep them healthy.|sd|2505
B|Uh, we just bought, uh, acre, a house with an acre to try to, so she'll have some room to walk around, and not off of a busy street.|sd|2505
A|Oh, how neat.|ba|2505
B|We're, we're choosing our house for our cat.|sd|2505
B|Isn't that bad|qh|2505
A|People do it for their children|sv|2505
A|I mean, why not.|qh|2505
B|Oh, them too|sd|2505
A|Well you know, why not,|qh|2505
A|why not.|qh|2505
B|because I, she loves, she's one of those that loves outside,|sd|2505
A|Yeah.|b|2505
B|and, and she doesn't go far|sd|2505
B|but she just wants to be able to have that freedom.|sd|2505
A|Yeah,|b|2505
A|well if you're off, off, of a, you know, away from a road,|sv|2505
A|and.|%|2505
A|You're off of the main road, you said?|qy^d|2505
B|Yeah,|ny|2505
B|yeah.|ny|2505
A|Away from a road, you know, and you keep an eye on her, it's probably okay.|sv|2505
A|I'm just real,|sd|2505
A|I don't know, I guess,|h|2505
A|I'm in a neighborhood|sd|2505
A|and it's, it's just real tough on animals here, you know.|sv|2505
B|Yeah,|b|2505
B|it gets hard, especially with the cars.|sv|2505
A|I, every time I see one run over I just, you know,|sd|2505
A|it makes me sick,|sd|2505
A|so, you know,|%|2505
B|Oh, I know.|aa|2505
A|but anyway, we kind of got off the subject of children,|sv|2505
B|Yeah.|b|2505
A|except that I consider them my children|sd|2505
B|Yeah,|b|2505
B|our cats are our kids|bf|2505
B|or,|%|2505
A|Yeah.|aa|2505
B|I, we, we got married a few months ago|sd|2505
B|and I'm like, well why can't Ashley be at the wedding|sd|2505
A|Oh, no.|ba|2505
A|In, in her little bridesmaid dress|^2|2505
B|Yeah,|aa|2505
B|you know, if I could have, I would have.|sd|2505
A|Well I'm sure it's been done.|sv|2505
A|I'm sure it has been done.|sv|2505
A|Well they have weddings for dogs now and cats|sd|2505
A|and,|%|2505
B|Oh.|b|2505
A|you know, they have all that parties for them where they dress up.|sv|2505
A|I've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a|sd|2505
B|Oh, my.|ba|2505
A|I haven't gone that far.|sd|2505
A|I'm not that bonkers.|sd|2505
B|No|b|2505
A|You know, my cats do not wear clothes,|sd|2505
A|an|%|2505
B|I, I don't think they'd like to.|sv|2505
A|No.|aa|2505
B|I put a bow on her one one day|sd|2505
B|and Jerry just kept saying you are the meanest person|sd|2505
B|I took a picture of her|sd|2505
B|and that was all it, all it lasted for.|sd|2505
A|do any of your friends have, have, uh, older children that they do anything with.|qy|2505
A|Do, do you have friends with older children,|qy|2505
A|or do they just all have young kids.|qrr|2505
B|Um, yeah,|ny|2505
B|all the ones I know,|sd|2505
B|my brother-in-law has three young kids seven and on down|sd|2505
B|and they, they go on family vacations|sd|2505
B|and, uh, they go, like to go skiing,|sd|2505
B|the, the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention,|sd|2505
B|but, uh, this last ski trip they took, uh, she had contracted chicken pox first|sd|2505
B|and then she spread it to her, her younger sister and her brother|sd|2505
B|and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation, where she got better.|sd|2505
B|So, not only is she the better skier, but she got all the attention, because she got to go out.|sd|2505
B|I think she planned it.|sv|2505
B|She's only five,|sd|2505
B|but I think she planned it|sv|2505
B|And she got all the attention from her dad.|sd|2505
A|Oh, see there,|ba|2505
A|she needed that, didn't she.|qy|2505
B|oh yeah.|ny|2505
A|You know, it must be hard when you have a lot of children,|sv|2505
A|I, you know, to I was an only child,|sd|2505
A|my mother was an only child|sd|2505
A|so, I, you know, I wasn't raised with brothers or sisters|sd|2505
A|and I always got all the attention,|sd|2505
A|so I wouldn't know.|sd|2505
A|I think I would be extremely jealous, or would have been, had there been another child in the family.|sv|2505
B|Yeah,|b|2505
B|it's, it's, we can see it work with her,|sd|2505
A|Tough,|^2|2505
A|it must be tough.|sv|2505
B|she's frustrated.|sd|2505
A|Yeah,|b|2505
A|yeah.|b|2505
A|she, she's the middle one?|qy^d|2505
B|Yeah.|ny|2505
A|So she's never been the only one,|sd|2505
A|so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one.|sv|2505
B|Right.|b|2505
A|Yeah,|b|2505
A|that's tough, you know ...|sv|2505
A|So, what do you,|qw|2567
A|what's your opinion on the, our policy down there?|qo|2567
B|I don't think we have one.|sv|2567
A|I didn't know we had one either|sv|2567
B|Yeah.|b|2567
B|I was going to say it's kind of hard to have, have an opinion.|sd|2567
B|We seem to, uh,|sv|2567
B|whoever screams the loudest or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support, without,  regard whether it's a democracy or a anarchy, or anything else.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
A|I don't,|%|2567
A|Yeah|b|2567
A|The only thing that I pretty much know about is the Central American policy where, you know, they're just trying to, you know,|sd|2567
A|military action in Panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now,|sd|2567
B|Well, uh,|b|2567
A|and then,|%|2567
B|yeah.|b|2567
B|And then, of course, there was, there was the, uh, in Columbia, with the drug lords.|sd|2567
A|Right.|b|2567
B|But we just talked a lot.|sv|2567
B|We didn't actually do anything.|sv|2567
A|Right.|aa|2567
A|Well, that's, that's what I was about to say.|sd|2567
A|We didn't do anything.|sv|2567
B|I'm actually surprised at anything in Central America, along with Panama.|sv|2567
B|I'm just kind of surprised we did that.|sv|2567
A|Yeah,|b|2567
B|But, uh,|%|2567
A|that is, that is pretty, uh, risky.|sv|2567
A|I, mean,|%|2567
B|Especially, after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway.|aa|2567
A|Uh-huh.|b|2567
B|But I guess they had to finally do something.|sv|2567
B|Actually Bush has been better at that than I thought.|sv|2567
A|Uh-huh.|b|2567
B|He has a little more a little more of a stand on policy than I thought he would.|sv|2567
B|I always considered him kind of a wimp.|sv|2567
A|He takes more risks.|sv|2567
B|Yeah.|b|2567
B|Reagan is kind of mushmouth.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|aa|2567
A|He was.|aa|2567
B|But, but I guess most of the policy that we're using now is, uh, a combination of Reagan and Carter, much as, you know, policy makers.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
A|It seems that the, the policies of pretty much anywhere, not just in Central America, that U S has now is, is, you know, more action than just words, than just rhetoric.|sv|2567
A|But, you know, we, we back up what we what we say with actions.|sv|2567
B|Uh, yeah.|b|2567
B|We have so far,|sv|2567
B|but we,  really haven't,|sd|2567
A|I don't know, how long it's going to last.|sd|2567
B|Of course, we really haven't taken on the drug lords, yet.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
B|I'd be interested to see if we do that.|sv|2567
A|Well, I don't think it's possible because, even though, you know, we're against them, I don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country's problem.|sv|2567
B|Well, we did in Panama.|sv|2567
B|We did in,  Saudi Arabia.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
A|But,|%|2567
A|no,|ar|2567
A|but see the thing when Panama was, uh, the, that, uh, Noriega was, uh, was, was, uh, was wanted either the F B I, by the F B I,|sv|2567
A|and therefore, they had a reason|sv|2567
A|But, to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because,|sv|2567
B|It could be an interesting, interesting problem.|sv|2567
A|Right.|b|2567
B|I don't know if they could do it or not.|sv|2567
B|Did you read Tom Clancy's A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER?|qy|2567
A|Uh, no.|nn|2567
A|I didn't.|sd|2567
B|I think you need to pick that up and read it.|sv|2567
B|It's quite, uh, it's, it's quite interesting.|sv|2567
B|It addresses the problem.|sd|2567
A|Oh, the drug problem?|br|2567
B|Uh-huh.|ny|2567
A|Uh-huh.|b^m|2567
B|Actually, he, he wrote that prior to the, uh, Medellin Cartel being exposed.|sd|2567
B|It was on the stands prior to that time.|sd|2567
B|It, it's quite timely.|sv|2567
B|And either he knows somebody|sd|2567
B|or he has a real good, a real good imagination|sd|2567
B|because its, it hits pretty close to home.|sd|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
B|But I don't think we're going to have much of a choice in either Central or South America.|sv|2567
A|I don't think, uh, I don't think, the, the, uh, problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon.|sv|2567
A|I mean, you know, it, I think it pretty much got sidetracked with, uh, with the Panama and, and with the Middle East problems.|sv|2567
A|Things that, that are important take precedent, precedence over the drugs, I think.|sv|2567
A|I think, I think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front|sv|2567
A|And|%|2567
A|you know, it, it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing,|sv|2567
A|so they're going to have to go to the source.|sv|2567
B|Um, yeah.|b|2567
B|I think we realize it's failed.|sv|2567
B|We just don't, we just don't,|%|2567
B|nobody,  wants to make the, nobody wants to make the unpopular decision of going in and invading,|sv|2567
A|Don't want to admit it yet.|^2|2567
A|Right.|b|2567
B|We still, there's still there's still too many Kennedys and and all up there.|sv|2567
A|Yep ause.|aa|2567
A|Yeah.|aa|2567
A|That's true.|sv|2567
B|There's too many liberals in control.|sv|2567
B|They can't agree on anything.|sv|2567
B|And they have blinders on as far as the policy goes.|sv|2567
B|As long as somebody's getting killed, as long as nobody knows about it it's okay.|sv|2567
B|But, but the minute it hit, hits the paper then, of course, the Kennedys and the and the and the, and, uh, the from Georgia, all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
B|Of course, these are the same people that also drown the Chappaquiddic, and stuff like that, you know.|sv|2567
A|Huh.|b|2567
B|But I guess it|%|2567
B|I guess it's automatic respective.|sv|2567
A|Depends on how much power you have,  and who you know.|sv|2567
B|Yeah.|b|2567
B|You know,  the people have a right to know except about what it, about what concerns them.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
B|And these are the people that make the foreign policy|sv|2567
B|and it, it's probably basically, uh,|%|2567
B|I would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of, uh, financial holdings in, in Central and South America.|sv|2567
A|Probably.|aa|2567
B|Considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway.|sv|2567
A|Huh.|b|2567
B|Every time you drink Scotch, you're paying Kennedys.|sv|2567
A|I don't drink Scotch.|sd|2567
B|Good.|ba|2567
B|Don't ever drink Scotch,|ad|2567
B|it's terrible.|sv|2567
B|I quit drinking Scotch when I found out about that,|sd|2567
B|but, anyway.|%|2567
B|But, uh, as far as, as far as, you know, Central and South America, we, our policy pretty much, uh, it depends on who we're, what government we're buying down there at the particular time.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567
A|I,  think we're trying to stay, uh, stay friendly with uh, the, uh, the Brazilian and, and Argentinean governments because they're producing so much, uh, agricultural exports.|sv|2567
B|We,|%|2567
A|We, don't want to piss them off and have them over produce|sv|2567
B|Yeah.|b|2567
B|Although we do need to do something about, you know,|sv|2567
B|of course, in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras, that's been going on for years.|sd|2567
B|But then, hell, it's probably still be going on long after we're dead.|sv|2567
B|It'll still be the same thing.|sv|2567
B|Those people down there don't really,|sv|2567
B|I mean,|%|2567
A|I think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better,|sv|2567
A|you know,  the same old cliche.|sd|2567
B|Well, I think basically,  they can't figure out what they want down there.|sv|2567
A|Right.|b|2567
B|If you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy, those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education.|sv|2567
A|Right.|b|2567
A|And they'll just pick crooked people again.|sv|2567
A|And then people, the, the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again,|sv|2567
A|and it'll all,  be for nothing.|sv|2567
B|It's all tradition.|sv|2567
B|It's all traditional.|sv|2567
B|They have to,|sv|2567
B|you have the ruling class|sv|2567
B|and you have everybody else.|sv|2567
A|Yeah.|b|2567

B|He he's the one who wrote, uh, RED OCTOBER, A HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.|sd|2567
A|Okay.|bk|2567
A|All right.|bk|2567

A|Bye-bye.|fc|2567

B|Clanking ishes oman and children|%|2702
A|Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something,|sd|2702
A|I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door|sd|2702
B|What kind of a car do you have now?|qw|2702
A|Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight,|sd|2702
A|and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same style.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|That same kind of four door, hard top style.|sd|2702
B|You got kids?|qy|2702
A|Uh, no|nn|2702
A|but we're planning for it.|sd|2702
B|Okay.|bk|2702
A|So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta Eighty-Eight|sd|2702
A|but it's in pretty good in really good shape.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|So that's probably where the first place we'd look.|sd|2702
B|Huh.|b|2702
A|But, uh,|%|2702
B|Well, we've always had, uh, Fords.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership|sd|2702
A|That'll do it.|ba|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
B|That'll do it.|sd|2702
B|Um, but, yeah, we're, we're in the same shape.|sd|2702
B|I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons,|sv|2702
A|Yeah.|b|2702
B|and we've got a minivan,|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|and that's great.|sv|2702
B|And I drive, uh,|%|2702
B|well I used to drive an Escort,|sd|2702
B|but it died on me.|sd|2702
B|So I, I mean I, I, I used to run it, I, uh, where we used to live, I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day.|sd|2702
A|Oh, geez.|ba|2702
B|And, uh, and this Escort took it all.|sd|2702
B|And it, it, it got up to, uh, uh, I was at ninety-four thousand miles on it,|sd|2702
B|and the engine just went.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries, which has been okay.|sd|2702
A|Yeah.|b|2702
A|Really?|bh|2702
B|I, I mean I've haven't had it that long.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|But it, it it's an eighty-five Aries,|sd|2702
B|but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when I bought it.|sd|2702
A|Oh, geez.|ba|2702
B|And I just, you know, I just drive it to work.|sd|2702
B|So it's just a ten minute commute every day.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|So, uh, it doesn't get much of, uh,|sd|2702
B|I mean, it's not like I'm putting it through its paces.|sv|2702
A|Yeah,|b|2702
A|yeah.|b|2702
B|But I think, uh,|%|2702
B|and it's a four door which is nice,|sv|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|but it's still a little cramped.|sv|2702
B|I've got three kids,|sd|2702
A|Yeah.|b|2702
B|so I, I,|%|2702
A|Sounds like you, you need at least like a Taurus size, or something like that.|bf|2702
B|Yeah,|aa|2702
B|that's what, I was thinking of,|aa|2702
B|was a Taurus.|sd|2702
B|Uh,|%|2702
A|Yeah.|b|2702
A|I, I know a lot of guys at work,|sd|2702
A|they, uh, the ones that have, uh, families, uh,|sd|2702
A|and they still want kind of a sports car.|sd|2702
A|They've been, uh, a lot of them have been getting these Taurus S H O's.|sd|2702
A|That I guess it's the sports version of the Taurus?|sd|2702
B|Oh, really?|bh|2702
B|Yeah|ny|2702
A|In fact, it comes with a standard stick|sd|2702
A|and, uh, and a lot of those.|sd|2702
B|Ooh.|ba|2702
A|And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that.|sd|2702
A|But, uh,|%|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|and usually they're in like black, and gun metal grey and those kind of colors.|sd|2702
A|You're not going to see too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that.|sv|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|They, they put them in sporty colors I guess.|sv|2702
A|But, uh,|%|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
B|Well, my wife wants a Miyata.|sd|2702
A|Oh, well sure|ba|2702
A|That's what, you know,|%|2702

A|What would I, besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car?|qh|2702
B|Right,|b|2702
B|yeah.|b|2702
B|I know,|aa|2702
B|I know.|aa|2702
B|It's like I, I guess I could fit in it maybe|sv|2702
A|Yeah.|b|2702
A|I, I went, I went through that when I first got out of, uh, college.|sd|2702
A|I had an old car that I bought just to get to, to my my first job.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire.|sd|2702
B|Oh.|b|2702
A|And I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a two seater, uh, sports car.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|But that, that just does not make it as an only car.|sv|2702
A|It's, uh, it's like I, I would,|sd|2702
A|I bought a set of stereo speakers|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|and it was one of those cash and carry deals.|sd|2702
A|I had to take them one at a time, with the top down.|sd|2702
A|And it was winter, so I was in like this coat with the top down,|sd|2702
B|Oh, no!|ba|2702
A|and the speaker in the passenger seat.|sd|2702
B|Yeah|b|2702
A|And I drove that one home,|sd|2702
A|and then I went back and got the other one and put that in the, passenger seat and drove that one home.|sd|2702
A|And, uh, funny, funniest sight.|sv|2702
A|And you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car.|sv|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
B|Well, I,|%|2702
B|you know, it's funny.|sv|2702
B|Most people that I've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college, or, you know, or when they were single anyway.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
A|Yeah.|b|2702
B|They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last.|sd|2702
B|I never did that.|sd|2702
B|Uh, you know, my first car was a Toyota Corolla.|sd|2702
A|Oh, really?|bh|2702
B|And, uh, because I got a good deal on it|sd|2702
A|Yeah.|b|2702
B|and, uh, that was a great little car.|sd|2702
B|Actually I met,|sd|2702
B|that's how I met girls was, I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission, which I, I had never,|sd|2702
B|I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission. And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
A|Boy, that's a good deal.|sv|2702
B|And, uh, in fact I married one of those people|sd|2702
A|Ah, okay.|b|2702
A|Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in that situation again|sd|2702
B|And it worked.|sd|2702
B|Yeah,|b|2702
B|it worked all right, real good.|sd|2702
A|Huh.|b|2702
A|Because I, I know we've, uh,|%|2702
A|that's, that's something that, that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission.|sd|2702
A|My, uh, my wife just can't, can't, uh,|sd|2702
A|she really doesn't want to learn I guess, the, uh, the standard shift.|sv|2702
B|Yeah,|b|2702
B|yeah.|b|2702
A|I fact, I, I remember once we, uh, we, uh, went, uh, went on a, uh, test drive.|sd|2702
A|We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|And we went, uh, we went, uh, we went to a dealership|sd|2702
A|and, uh, it, it was she, she did pretty well.|sd|2702
A|But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot|sd|2702
B|Yeah|b|2702
A|and the, uh, dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking,|sd|2702
A|because that was all it was.|sd|2702
A|It was, it was the funniest thing,|sd|2702
A|it was like, uh, a big Le Baron,|sd|2702
A|it was a Le Baron with everything on it,|sd|2702
B|Wow!|ba|2702
A|but it had a standard shift.|sd|2702
A|It was the craziest thing I ever saw.|sv|2702
B|That's weird!|ba|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess.|sv|2702
B|Huh.|b|2702
A|And, uh, we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth.|sd|2702
A|She did pretty well after a while.|sd|2702
B|Yeah.|b|2702
A|But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess.|sv|2702
B|Well, my wife,|%|2702
B|I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|And, uh, and,|%|2702
B|in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission.|sd|2702
B|In fact, the minivan's a, has a stick shift.|sd|2702
A|Um, okay.|b|2702
B|And in,|%|2702
B|this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything.|sd|2702
B|You know, it's got automatic transmission, cruise control, you know, electric locks.|sd|2702
A|Oh, geez.|ba|2702
B|You know, it's like, it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know.|sv|2702
A|Yeah,|b|2702
A|yeah.|b|2702
B|So, uh,|%|2702
A|Oh, well.|b|2702
A|Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say, about cars|sd|2702
B|Well, you, um,|%|2702
B|the, the thing about this, uh,|sv|2702
B|I will say this about the minivan.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it.|sv|2702
A|Uh-huh,|aa|2702
A|I would think so,|sv|2702
A|yeah,|aa|2702
B|It, it,|%|2702
A|because it's so big.|bf|2702
B|Yeah.|aa|2702
B|And, and it was quiet,|sd|2702
B|it had a stereo system.|sd|2702
A|Oh, yeah.|b|2702
B|We never had it, you know,|sd|2702
B|we always had the A M radio.|sd|2702
A|Sure,|b|2702
A|sure.|b|2702
B|And, uh, of course this has, this that had speakers that you can control from the back seat.|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|And you can change the channels on the, on the radio from the back seat too|sd|2702
A|Uh-huh.|b|2702
B|And put speaker phones in it.|sd|2702
B|So.|%|2702
A|Now, now, now that used to be a luxury,|sv|2702
A|but I bet on the next time you buy a car, that's going to be mandatory.|sv|2702
B|Right.|aa|2702
A|You've got to have that now.|sv|2702
B|That's right.|aa|2702
B|That's right.|aa|2702
A|You're used to it|sv|2702
A|and you got to have it.|sv|2702
B|And you've got to pay for it too.|sd|2702
A|Yeah.|aa|2702
A|That's true too.|aa|2702
B|And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when I bought mine|sv|2702
A|It, It probably does,|aa|2702
A|it probably does.|aa|2702
A|But, uh,|%|2702
B|We,|%|2702
A|Oh, well.|b|2702
A|Well, Bill it's been nice talking to you.|fc|2702
B|Nice talking to you.|fc|2702
A|Okay,|fc|2702
A|you have a good evening.|fc|2702
B|Thanks a lot.|ft|2702
A|Um.|fc|2702
A|Bye-bye.|fc|2702
B|Bye-bye|fc|2702
A|What kind,|qw|2733
B|What kind of cars do you, do you usually drive?|qw|2733
A|Right now we, I've got a, uh, four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda.|sd|2733
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba|2733
B|Well, we're, we're, we're sort of, sort of a General Motors family,|sd|2733
B|I guess that's the way we were raised.|sv|2733
B|And, uh, uh, we were overseas with T I for a number of years|sd|2733
B|and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family.|sd|2733
A|Oh, goodness.|b|2733
B|Yeah,|b|2733
B|and four cars|sd|2733
B|and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental.|sd|2733
A|Really?|bh|2733
B|At least two of them.|sd|2733
B|We bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark.|sd|2733
B|Uh, for, you know,|%|2733
B|they each had twenty-one thousand miles or something like that.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them|sv|2733
B|and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that.|sd|2733
B|Uh, then we've got an eighty-six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new.|sd|2733
B|My daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And we've got a eighty-four Toyota that we bought used.|sd|2733
B|So we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers.|sd|2733
B|It's like musical chairs|sd|2733
A|I bet.|ba|2733
B|You're one short.|sd|2733
A|I bet.|ba|2733
B|And, uh,|%|2733
B|but you know, it's interesting the two,|sv|2733
B|even though my dad was a Chevrolet man forever and ever and ever|sd|2733
B|and we were in the retail milk business|sd|2733
B|and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks|sd|2733
B|and, and we bought automobiles and all that,|sd|2733
B|it was almost like|%|2733
B|and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend|sd|2733
B|and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a, but a Chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave|sd|2733
B|But, uh,|%|2733
A|Yep.|b|2733
B|as we got older and got away,|sd|2733
B|and then we thought, well, you know, you still could buy General Motors products|sd|2733
B|and it was probably not that bad.|sv|2733
B|But, uh, we lived in Malaysia for T I in nineteen, uh, eighty-one, two, three, and four.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And, and, of course you don't buy General Motors products over there|sd|2733
A|No.|aa|2733
B|But we bought a Volvo|sd|2733
B|and I have never had a car that I've loved more.|sd|2733
B|I just can't afford them here.|sd|2733
B|Uh, but I, I just loved that car.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And, uh, we bought a, uh,|sd|2733
B|we lived in the Philippines for T I in eighty-five, eighty-six, and eighty-seven|sd|2733
B|and we bought a, uh, Ford Telstar,|sd|2733
B|which is somewhat similar to the Taurus.|sd|2733
B|It's sold in, uh, in uh, the Far Eastern uh, Far East countries more than here.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|But we really liked that.|sd|2733
B|And have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have?|qy|2733
A|Well, yeah|ny|2733
A|we had, uh, we had,|%|2733
A|these are the first cars that my husband and I have ever purchased ourselves.|sd|2733
B|Um.|b|2733
A|The others were hand me downs through the families.|sd|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|And those were always G M cars.|sd|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|Uh, Buicks and Chevrolets.|sd|2733
B|Uh-huh.|b|2733
A|And, uh, we were real happy with them,|sd|2733
A|but all the ones that we ever had were the, you know, eight cylinder,|sd|2733
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2733
A|really rugged, G M cars.|sd|2733
B|The the big,|bf|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|And all we had heard was, was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars,|sd|2733
A|and we both drive, well, forty-five miles round trip every day.|sd|2733
B|Sure,|b|2733
B|sure.|b|2733
A|And so we wanted a smaller car,|sd|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|when we got ready to buy, we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage|sd|2733
A|and quite frankly, we were afraid of the, of the G M small cars.|sv|2733
B|Uh-huh,|b|2733
B|uh-huh.|b|2733
A|You know, as far as durability.|sd|2733
B|Right.|b|2733
A|So we kind of,|%|2733
A|when we had our larger cars, we didn't mind, uh, keeping them up,|sd|2733
B|Uh-huh.|b|2733
A|you know, doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often.|sd|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|But, once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them, all of them, you know,|sd|2733
A|it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them|sd|2733
B|Yeah,|b|2733
B|yeah,|b|2733
B|it seems that something goes every month.|bf|2733
A|Yeah|aa|2733
A|it,|%|2733
B|And I'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours,|sd|2733
B|you know,|%|2733
B|we got three eighty-sixes and an eighty-four|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And we'll probably be there with all of them.|sv|2733
B|You know, it's the same thing, you know,|sv|2733
B|I don't know whether, uh, you classify the Skylark and the Calais as,|sd|2733
B|well I guess they're intermediate.|sv|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|Uh, but, uh, we went on a family trip to Massachusetts|sd|2733
B|and there were five of us|sd|2733
B|and five, five of us never go anywhere together here.|sd|2733
B|everybody's heading off in their own direction.|sd|2733
A|Right.|b|2733
B|And I rented a Buick Le Sabre,|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|and it's the first big car I had since I had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy-six to eighty.|sd|2733
B|And it made all the,|%|2733
B|I, I had forgotten what driving a big car was like.|sd|2733
A|It's like a yacht.|sv|2733
B|It was just nice.|sv|2733
B|It floated.|sv|2733
A|Yeah.|b|2733
A|What,|%|2733
A|we, we sold or we, we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru.|sd|2733
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2733
A|Yeah,|b^m|2733
A|it was a great car.|sv|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|It just,|%|2733
A|we ran the wheels right off of it.|sd|2733
B|Yeah,|b|2733
B|yeah,|b|2733
B|yeah.|b|2733
B|And, uh, you know I've read,|sd|2733
B|I'm in the quality business at T I,|sd|2733
B|I'm a quality manager|sd|2733
B|and we're, we're uh, we deal,|sd|2733
B|we sell,|sd|2733
B|I'm in the semiconductor group|sd|2733
B|and we sell to, uh, Ford, Chrysler and G M, uh, G M Delco.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And there is a, amazing,|sv|2733
B|I am just, uh, really impressed with the, with the quality consciousness that the, these companies have put into their procurement|sd|2733
B|and it's, I, it's come out as a result of the competition from the Japanese.|sv|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And, uh, uh, I|%|2733
B|and, you know, we used to think Ford products were tinny.|sd|2733
B|I mean I was growing up,|sd|2733
B|I was taught when I was growing up, you know, that, that that real people bought General Motors products,|sd|2733
B|and peons bought, Ford products.|sv|2733
A|That's right.|aa|2733
B|But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants|sv|2733
B|and they're really, uh, uh, stressing this partnerships in quality,|sd|2733
B|and you know, G M and Chrysler are doing that,|sd|2733
B|but I really think Ford's got a ship position in this right now.|sv|2733
B|And I think it's showing up in their automobiles.|sv|2733
B|Their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now.|sv|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And, uh, uh, we went to, uh, Austin a while back to a basketball tournament|sd|2733
B|and we were going to be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there,|sd|2733
B|so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down, we'd rent one,|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|and we went up to the local Budget|sd|2733
B|and we were going to get a Olds eighty-eight or something.|sd|2733
B|He said I'll tell you what, for a dollar a day more I'll give you a Lincoln Town Car.|sd|2733
A|Um.|b|2733
B|And we drove that down|sd|2733
B|and I hated to turn that back in.|sd|2733
A|I bet|ba|2733
B|We had that for three days.|sd|2733
B|And I absolutely loved,|sd|2733
B|except I couldn't want to have to park it in tight places all the time.|sd|2733
A|No.|aa|2733
B|Uh,|b|2733
A|I wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas, either.|sv|2733
B|but I absolutely loved that automobile.|sd|2733
B|And, you know, it wasn't that I'd,|%|2733
B|driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon,|sv|2733
B|but on the trip down and back I filled up both coming and going|sd|2733
B|so I knew what I actually got on the trip|sd|2733
B|and it was about twenty-four miles a gallon.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|Uh, and, you know, we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it, let it float.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And, it was pretty nice.|sv|2733
B|Are, are, are you planning on getting any additional or other cars?|qy|2733
A|No time soon.|ng|2733
A|Uh, we're, our, our, we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years.|sd|2733
B|Um.|b|2733
B|Oh, yours is small.|qy^d|2733
A|Yes.|ny|2733
A|So, we, uh, so we don't plan on purchasing any more any time soon.|sd|2733
A|Both of our cars are getting, oh, around sixty thousand miles on them.|sd|2733
B|Um.|b|2733
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2733
A|We drive a lot.|sd|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
B|You got another, another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them.|sv|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|Uh, we've got,|sd|2733
B|probably we'll get something in the next couple years.|sd|2733
B|My son will graduate from high school this year,|sd|2733
B|and, and he's going to go to Richland College one year behind us,|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|it's right,|sd|2733
B|in fact, uh, our house is adjacent to the Richland property.|sd|2733
B|He wants to go to Texas Tech|sd|2733
B|and he's probably going to have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order,|sv|2733
B|but, uh, the next year when he goes out to Tech, he wants a pickup,|sd|2733
B|and I want, a pickup.|sd|2733
A|A pickup aint.|b^m|2733
B|I may get one and not let him have it|sd|2733
B|But, we have been looking at these red|sd|2733
B|they, they're very popular around here.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|These, uh, uh, red Chevy pickups,|sd|2733
B|and, uh, we'll probably do something like that,|sd|2733
B|uh, uh, incidentally,|%|2733
B|uh, uh, I don't know,|h|2733
B|uh, the, uh, the Credit Union has got a deal now where you decide what you want|sd|2733
B|and you call this number|sd|2733
B|and, uh, they go negotiate the price for you.|sd|2733
B|And, and, or, or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|and, uh, my boss just bought a Chevy pickup|sd|2733
B|and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way.|sd|2733
A|Really?|bh|2733
B|Yeah.|ny|2733
B|And, uh, uh, you know, you, you figure out the options, go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and, and tell him what you want|sd|2733
B|and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy, a certain person at that dealer's place.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|So I'm going to try that the next time I buy one.|sd|2733
A|I think that would be a good idea.|sv|2733
B|And, and, so, you know, I can go around and comparison shop and see if I can get a better negotiation on my own.|sd|2733
B|But, once, one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating.|sv|2733
A|Yeah.|b|2733
A|I've, we've, we've, we've kind of been the types that will say, this is what we intend to spend,|sd|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|this is the car we want,|^q|2733
A|will you sell me this car for that price.|^q|2733
B|And for that price.|^2|2733
A|And, and we've had|%|2733
A|we, with our,|%|2733
A|when we bought our Subaru, the guy was like, you can't do this to me,|sd|2733
A|and we're were just, like, okay fine, we, we won't then.|sd|2733
B|We'll go somewhere else.|bf|2733
B|Yeah.|%|2733
A|You know.|%|2733
A|I mean he's like, no, no, no.|sd|2733
B|Yeah.|b|2733
A|But,|%|2733
B|And, uh, and I, I think that's probably the way you've got to do it.|sv|2733
B|When, when I was young, I went in and bought a, uh, or made a deal on a sixty,|sd|2733
B|this is nineteen sixty,|sd|2733
B|I'd first come to Texas, and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible that I just loved,|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|and this guy gave me this deal, you know,|sd|2733
B|I told him how much I wanted to pay,|sd|2733
B|and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss|sd|2733
B|and then I'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate, uh, we would go ahead and buy.|sd|2733
B|Uh, uh, if he could get this rate I promised to buy|sd|2733
B|and I left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted.|sd|2733
B|I, I was only twenty-five years old or something|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|I, I left there|sd|2733
B|and I, I, uh, I'd never done this before because I'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from,|sd|2733
B|and, uh, uh, so I, I got back|sd|2733
B|and a salesman that lived in the apartment had, asked me, uh, uh, if,|sd|2733
B|he'd heard I was going to get a car, and asked me what I paid for it.|sd|2733
B|He said, well, hey, uh, before you go buying anything,|sd|2733
B|he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point.|sd|2733
B|There was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there.|sd|2733
A|Uh-huh.|b|2733
B|And I called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning|sd|2733
B|and just driving fifty miles out of town, it was a difference,|sd|2733
B|and, I mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars,|sd|2733
B|but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty-five hundred,|sd|2733
A|Goodness.|ba|2733
B|is all we paid for cars in those days.|sd|2733
B|And, uh, uh, so I called back the guy in Dallas|sd|2733
B|and I told him that,|sd|2733
B|I'd left him a check for tax, title and license and everything,|sd|2733
B|and I said I want to cancel my order and, and don't try to cash the check because I'm going to, I've stopped payment on it already|sd|2733
B|and he says oh, somebody's taking,|sd|2733
B|he said what did you get a deal for, Bill.|sd|2733
B|And I told him,|sd|2733
B|he says, somebody's taking you for a ride.|sd|2733
B|And I said, no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday|sd|2733
A|That's right.|aa|2733
B|And, uh, uh, and I, I find that, uh,|%|2733
B|and for the longest time then I drove up to Will's Point|sd|2733
B|and, and the, and the fellow died since then,|sd|2733
B|and, and some of his relatives have taken over the business|sd|2733
B|and that,|%|2733
B|but|%|2733
B|and, since then I had ...|sd|2733
A|Uh, our children are both, uh, basically adults.|sd|3035
A|They, we've, we've got two.|sd|3035
A|Uh, one is twenty-one,|sd|3035
A|and one is twenty-five.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|And they, they still live at home.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|Well, that's, that's a little unusual for, uh, for children of that age, to have both of them that age at home.|sv|3035
A|But, uh, I guess the activities that, uh, we have with them are, uh, pretty few and far between.|sv|3035
A|Actually the, they're both going on their own most of the time.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|So, uh, most of our activities are, you know, just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh|b|3035
B|Well, we have a, uh, three year old and a one year old.|sd|3035
B|And, uh, so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know.|sd|3035
A|Sure it does.|aa|3035
B|And, uh, most of the time with a three year old we're trying to, to get him, uh,|sd|3035
B|well, we play usually in the evening when, when I get home, you know, about five o'clock or so until about eight, you know, with the exception of dinner.|sd|3035
B|Out in the front or backyard playing like, uh, tee ball off the, you know, off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball.|sd|3035
B|Uh, since we just got here we got the, uh, uh, new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him,|sd|3035
B|and he really likes riding that around.|sd|3035
A|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|Oh, yeah.|b|3035
A|I,|%|3035
B|So, you know,|%|3035
B|and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and, uh, playing squirt guns and all that,|sd|3035
B|he really likes that.|sd|3035
A|Yeah.|b|3035
B|And, uh, the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything,|sd|3035
B|trying to do everything he does.|sd|3035
A|Yeah,|b|3035
A|is the one year old a boy?|qy|3035
B|No,|nn|3035
B|it's a girl.|sd|3035
A|A girl?|b^m|3035
B|Yeah.|ny|3035
A|ours, uh, the older one is a girl,|sd|3035
A|so.|%|3035
A|And the, and the younger one is a boy,|sd|3035
A|so.|%|3035
B|Yeah.|b|3035
A|Uh, I guess, uh, what I see is so far as, uh, the trends, uh, uh, for children, uh,|sv|3035
A|I don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is,|sd|3035
A|but, of course, uh, Richardson is in the Dallas area.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|And I think, uh, the big city, uh,|sv|3035
A|activities for, for children now are,|sd|3035
A|they're good|sv|3035
A|but there's so much, uh, potential danger, you know,|sv|3035
A|that you really have to watch your children so closely now|sv|3035
A|that, you can't let them grow up the way, the way I grew up, you know.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|I, I'm from a smaller town in east Texas.|sd|3035
A|And I could, you know, go and do whatever, pretty much whatever I wanted to do, uh, my whole life.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|Uh, you know, I never, never had to worry about the bad guys being out there.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|And, uh, you know, I find it's, it's quite a bit different now|sv|3035
A|that, uh, you know, you have to watch your children so closely and, uh, keep up with them.|sv|3035
A|I, I feel like, uh,|sv|3035
A|that it's, it's really a sad commentary on, uh, you know, a life in general,|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|that, uh, you know that children can't, cannot be allowed to grow up, uh, you know, without really close supervision.|sv|3035
B|Well, I, I agree with that,|aa|3035
B|and I seem, I seem to feel the same way, you know,|sv|3035
B|even just when I grew up and everything.|sd|3035
B|And, and, the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is, is at hand and everything.|sv|3035
A|Uh-huh.|b|3035
B|Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's been a lot of or more emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with|sv|3035
B|and, and the looking, you know,|%|3035
B|just start not even,|sd|3035
B|not really looking for a school for him but, uh, like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something.|sd|3035
A|Uh-huh.|b|3035
B|For, for a three year old it's that, uh,|sd|3035
B|there's a lot of emphasis on, on, on, on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten.|sv|3035
A|Right.|b|3035
B|And, and it seems like it's a lot more than they need to know and be able to do than when we are the, when I had to go in kindergarten.|sv|3035
A|Yeah.|b|3035
B|And it seems like it's more, uh,|sv|3035
B|you know, I don't know.|h|3035
B|They're expecting more or, uh, or just, uh, you know,|sv|3035
B|kids just because of the computer age or whatever, it just, know more when they get, you know, to be five or six or something.|sv|3035
A|Yeah.|b|3035
B|But,|%|3035
A|Um, I guess looking at, uh, back at, at what our children did compared to what, uh, you know, what I had to go through in school.|sd|3035
A|The, uh, there there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum.|sv|3035
A|It's a lot more complicated.|sv|3035
A|A lot more available, of course.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|But, uh, this,|%|3035
A|so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult, I would think.|sv|3035
A|I, I would probably have a hard time getting through school myself.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|Uh, you know, just,|%|3035
A|or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when I went to school.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
B|One thing is I got a home computer too|sd|3035
B|and, uh, I play, uh, with the three year old|sd|3035
B|I play some computer games and stuff with him.|sd|3035
A|Uh-huh.|b|3035
B|Educational games like, you know, concentration type games, the matching, things like that.|sd|3035
A|Right.|b|3035
A|Yeah.|b|3035
B|And, uh, he's, he really likes it|sd|3035
B|and, uh, and I think it's important because I think that, uh, you know, it gives him the interaction with the computer|sv|3035
B|because it sure looks like that's going to be you know, the big thing for a long time.|sv|3035
A|Huh,|b|3035
B|And given, given that knowledge and stuff with it|sd|3035
A|yeah,|b|3035
A|I think, uh,|%|3035
B|and he seems to enjoy it.|sv|3035
A|ery faint Oh.|b|3035
B|And, uh, of course, the one year old hasn't, hasn't gotten there yet|sd|3035
B|but, uh,|%|3035
B|and the other thing we try to do is, uh, since the here is, uh, sign him up for, and her, for, uh, different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming,|sd|3035
A|Right.|b|3035
B|you know, uh,|%|3035
B|or,|%|3035
B|there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for a week or so|sd|3035
B|and, uh, you know,|%|3035
B|where they go for an hour or so.|sd|3035
A|Yeah.|b|3035
B|And, uh,|%|3035
B|because, uh, when he was a baby that we did the swimming too|sd|3035
B|and he really liked it|sd|3035
B|so we're going to do that with our daughter too.|sd|3035
A|Yeah.|b|3035
A|That, uh, uh, watching a little, little boys play soccer is, is more fun.|sv|3035
A|I can't imagine them having as much fun as the parents, had watching them|sv|3035
B|I know.|aa|3035
B|Well, we were just talking about that too.|sd|3035
B|And I guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a, well, kick the ball around for a while, see what happens|sv|3035
A|Right,|b|3035
A|yeah|b|3035
A|The, the disorganized play really what it was,|bf|3035
A|but, but, uh,|%|3035
B|Yeah.|aa|3035
A|yeah,|b|3035
A|when ours was a,|sd|3035
A|he,|%|3035
A|I guess he was probably five or six, you know, when he first started playing soccer.|sd|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|And, uh, and that was, that was more fun to watch those boys trying to, trying to kick the ball up and down the field.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|But, uh,|%|3035
A|and it's,|%|3035
A|I guess, that was, you know, as important, uh, as much important to the parents as it was to the children that, uh, you know, to get out and watch the kids play,|sv|3035
A|so.|%|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|I guess one of the things that I think about is a, talking about education, uh, I kind of feel like, uh, that, uh, the, the school systems in this, particularly in this area, the systems are not under enough control.|sv|3035
A|The, the students have a little too much, uh, too much leeway.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|Excuse me.|fa|3035
A|Um, and the, and that's kind of contradictory to what I said|sv|3035
A|but, you know, you,|%|3035
A|the,|%|3035
A|you have to be under control so much when they're out|sv|3035
A|but when they're in school they, they don't have quite, quite as much control, over them as, uh, as what I would liked to have seen.|sv|3035
B|Right,|b|3035
B|right.|b|3035
B|Right.|b|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|Uh, uh, I kind of feel like there's, there's too much allowed to go on in at, at school.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|And, uh, you know, it tends to, uh, to encourage students to not be as, you know, to not concentrate as much on the education.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|You know, they're, they're there for a good time.|sv|3035
B|Right.|b|3035
A|And, you know, to, to see how little they can get by with.|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
B|Well, I know of number of people that are in the, in the, uh, school district down in, in, uh, San Antonio.|sd|3035
B|And, uh, it seems like it's,|sv|3035
B|a lot of the problem is to, you know,|sv|3035
B|you always have the lack of funds|sd|3035
B|but it seems to be getting worse and worse|sv|3035
B|and so they don't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as, as, as, kids need.|sv|3035
A|Right.|b|3035
B|And, uh, you know, that's just a problem that who knows how that's going to, that's going to come out or anything.|sv|3035
A|But, uh,|%|3035
B|But,|%|3035
A|ery faint Yeah.|b|3035
A|But, uh, I, I don't, I don't know|h|3035
A|I think, uh, you know, some of the thing has to do with, uh, with the civil rights program.|sv|3035
A|Not that the civil rights program is bad|sv|3035
A|but that there's,|%|3035
A|it carried over, into, you know, individual rights|sv|3035
B|Uh-huh.|b|3035
A|and it, you know, trickled|%|3035
A|Well, Tom, just tonight, I was working on my car out of necessity,|sd|3129
A|and I had, uh, uh, had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working,|sd|3129
A|uh, this is the type of, uh, switch where you flip the, the lever, the turn signal on the column|sd|3129
B|Yeah.|b|3129
A|and when I would, uh, put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely,|sd|3129
A|which is even worse than them just not getting bright|sv|3129
B|Exactly.|aa|3129
A|And I had presumed that it was the switch,|sd|3129
A|and, uh, this is, uh, an older car,|sd|3129
A|it's a seventy-two M G,|sd|3129
A|so I had to mail order the part, uh,|sd|3129
A|which I had done,|sd|3129
A|and tonight I went out and, uh, at least hooked in the new part, only to discover that that apparently is not the problem,|sd|3129
A|it's not in the switch, because it does the same thing with the new switch.|sd|3129
B|Oh.|b|3129
A|So I'll be faced with having to return that product and, uh, hoping that, uh, you know, that they will accept it,|sd|3129
A|although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used.|sd|3129
B|Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed?|qy|3129
A|Uh, I had done what diagnosis I could, primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that I did have of the car and, uh, pretty much decided that that had to be the problem.|sd|3129
B|Uh-huh.|b|3129
A|I talked to one mechanic about it,|sd|3129
A|and he suspected the switch also.|sd|3129
A|Uh, but I've not, you know,|%|3129
A|I really don't know what the problem might be.|sd|3129
A|It, it, the other switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off, which is on the dashboard|sv|3129
B|Uh-huh.|b|3129
A|uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow,|sv|3129
A|but,|%|3129
B|Yeah, I know,|b|3129
B|uh, when working with the, uh, flashers, there is, uh, usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.|sv|3129
B|Do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam?|qy|3129
A|I I don't know,|no|3129
A|I should look at that.|sv|3129
A|I don't remember seeing one in the, uh, in the diagram|sd|3129
B|Diagram.|^2|3129
A|so I'll have to go back and look at that.|sd|3129
B|Yeah,|b|3129
B|I don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse.|sd|3129
B|I know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit, like the headlamp|sd|3129
A|Uh-huh.|b|3129
B|you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing,|sd|3129
B|but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires, uh, the use of a, of a maybe a higher fuse.|sd|3129
A|Yeah,|b|3129
A|that's a good idea.|sv|3129
B|So, that's a possibility.|sv|3129
A|What I've typically found when that, uh,|sd|3129
A|companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all,|sv|3129
A|and I hope that that's the case this time.|sd|3129
B|Is this a, a mail order parts house that specializes in, in parts for parts for, uh, old imports?|qy|3129
A|Right,|na|3129
A|exactly|na|3129
B|Who,|%|3129
A|it's out of Kansas somewhere.|sd|3129
B|Um|b|3129
B|so, it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that.|qy^d|3129
A|No,|nn|3129
A|it's not.|sd|3129
A|I also got a piece of chrome for the, the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car,|sd|3129
A|but it is not either,|sd|3129
A|it's obviously doesn't quite fit,|sd|3129
A|so it must be for a different year,|sd|3129
A|so I'll have to try to return that as well.|sd|3129
B|Yeah,|b|3129
B|have you found any, uh, uh, reliable import service people in the metroplex?|qy|3129
A|Well, I had one person that I used for years and years on this car,|na|3129
A|because I've owned this car since it was new,|sd|3129
A|and, uh,|%|3129
A|but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area|sd|3129
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3129
B|Uh-huh.|b|3129
A|and I hadn't used him for some years,|sd|3129
A|and the last time I called him back it turned out that he had further specialized|sd|3129
A|instead of, uh, all import cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and ause German cars|sd|3129
B|I'll be darned.|ba|3129
A|I'm not sure that he works on much else at all,|sd|3129
A|but he doesn't work on British cars any more, and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it.|sd|3129
A|So, uh, uh, I may have to check with that person,|sd|3129
A|as it turns out that one, that shop is near where I now work.|sd|3129
A|So, I'll, uh, I should be able to take it in and check that part out.|sd|3129
A|I've not had to exchange any other parts recently, because they were defective.|sd|3129
A|Now, I've had, had pretty good luck,|sd|3129
A|I just, however, did, uh, have to get a, a, uh, one of these jam box portable dual cassette players, uh, repaired.|sd|3129
B|Uh-huh.|b|3129
A|I purchased it at Sam's,|sd|3129
A|and I had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty,|sd|3129
A|and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt,|sv|3129
A|because I didn't take it in right away, and let a whole year go by.|sd|3129
A|Uh, some of the buttons didn't work right, where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play,|sd|3129
A|and as it turned out, it had a full year's warranty,|sd|3129
A|and I could have gotten it repaired for free|sd|3129
A|but I had to take it in,|sd|3129
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba|3129
A|while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought had long since been lost,|sd|3129
A|uh, but it didn't do me any good, because I had, I had missed the window by about a week or two.|sd|3129
B|Oh, no.|ba|3129
A|So I didn't even, I didn't really, uh, even bring it up when I went in to pick it up.|sd|3129
A|But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect.|sd|3129
B|Well, ours wasn't within the last year.|sd|3129
B|I guess it's been within the last two years, uh,|sd|3129
B|Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new,|sd|3129
B|and it's one with the, uh, electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer, and, uh,|sd|3129
B|I don't know what else it all controls, but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort,|sd|3129
B|and we found that the, uh, uh, we were having two problems.|sd|3129
B|It was idling fast, when you first started the engine, to the point that we park on a hill, under our car port,|sd|3129
B|and, it, when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley,|sd|3129
B|and knowing that, you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard,|sd|3129
B|otherwise it would just wrench control away from you.|sd|3129
A|Good grief.|ba|3129
B|And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would, uh, be driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet stopped at the stop sign|sd|3129
A|Uh-huh.|b|3129
B|and the engine would just quit.|sd|3129
B|So, we took it back to the, uh, Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out,|sd|3129
B|and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing,|sd|3129
B|so they adjusted timing|sd|3129
B|and the problem didn't go away,|sd|3129
B|so we ended up taking it back again,|sd|3129
B|and I don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around,|sd|3129
B|but the second time around they looked at their, uh, recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever,|sd|3129
B|and, and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the, uh, computer control unit,|sd|3129
A|Huh.|b|3129
B|which fortunately they replaced under warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part|sd|3129
A|My goodness.|ba|3129
B|and, uh, so once they replaced it, then the, the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time,|sd|3129
A|Huh.|b|3129
B|and now it seems to be,|sd|3129
B|we we're not experiencing the stalling,|sd|3129
B|but we're still experiencing a very uneven,|sd|3129
A|Okay.|o_"_bc|3469
A|What do you think about it?|qo|3469
B|Uh, well, immigration,|sd|3469
B|I know they're really strict right now because my husband is from out of the country|sd|3469
B|and, uh, we had to go through a whole, very long process to, uh, to, assure the government that he was, uh, marrying me and not to be a resident here.|sd|3469
A|Uh-huh.|b|3469
A|That's|sv|3469
A|yeah,|b|3469
A|I think that's, uh, I think it's a little crazy.|sv|3469
A|I worked with Spanish people for about two years|sd|3469
B|Uh-huh.|b|3469
A|and just, it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers.|sv|3469
B|Yeah,|aa|3469
B|that's true.|aa|3469
B|I mean, you can't just come over to the country because, uh, you want to.|sv|3469
A|Right.|b|3469
B|You know, that's not good enough.|sv|3469
B|You have to have a, have to have a darn good reason of, political or whatever.|sv|3469
A|Right,|aa|3469
A|exactly.|aa|3469
B|Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.|sv|3469
A|Yeah,|b|3469
A|I think, you know, I think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to, to protect, you know, the people who are in the states.|sv|3469
B|Exactly.|aa|3469
B|My mother, uh, actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men just,|sd|3469
A|Uh-huh.|b|3469
B|she'd never even meet them|sd|3469
B|and she'd just get money for it.|sd|3469
A|Oh, you're kidding.|bh|3469
B|Huh-uh.|nn|3469
B|So,|%|3469
A|Sounds like a lot of fun.|sv|3469
A|Yeah,|%|3469
A|it's amazing to me how, how many things they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.|sv|3469
B|Exactly.|aa|3469
B|But, I mean, with the new laws, it's it's tough now.|sv|3469
A|Right.|b|3469
A|Yeah,|b|3469
A|it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.|sv|3469
B|Exactly.|aa|3469
A|You know, I think,|%|3469
B|Well, and, you know, uh, my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life, you know|sd|3469
A|Uh-huh.|b|3469
B|and they got here,|sd|3469
B|but now it's a, you know, it's so strict that you can't just do that.|sv|3469
A|Right,|aa|3469
A|exactly.|aa|3469
A|And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow a good number of people in every year|sv|3469
A|because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.|sv|3469
B|I agree.|aa|3469
A|And I just,|%|3469
A|I don't know,|h|3469
A|I have, personally I have a problem with it,|sd|3469
A|I think, that, you know, if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn't close our door.|sv|3469
B|Exactly.|aa|3469
B|If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.|sv|3469
B|They're going to be a productive citizen Zen.|sv|3469
A|And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when, you, you know, send them back to their country.|sv|3469
B|Yeah.|b|3469
A|And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in|sv|3469
A|and,|%|3469
B|Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent back to Mexico just to find their way back.|sv|3469
A|Yeah,|b|3469
A|and that's, that's what I think.|sv|3469
A|You know, I, I have to laugh|sd|3469
A|because, like I said, I worked with a lot of those|sd|3469
A|and they'd been deported two or three times|sd|3469
A|and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas. Or for any other time.|sd|3469
B|That's right,|sv|3469
B|that's our money.|sv|3469
B|Yes,|aa|3469
B|that's true.|sv|3469
A|But, I think, you know, I think all in all there's a lot of improvements.|sv|3469
A|I think the general idea is good|sv|3469
A|but, but there could be some work done in the area.|sv|3469
B|I, I think|%|3469
B|I, I agree.|aa|3469
A|Well good|ba|3469
A|Anyway, do you have anything else in the, the subject, uh that you might want to talk about?|qy|3469
B|Uh, I, uh,|%|3469
B|boy|ba|3469
B|this is spur of the moment, uh,|h|3469
B|but, I, I don't really see any, any changes that I think of really blatant right now|sv|3469
B|other than I think they ought to take, you know, on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a, uh, political refugee.|sv|3469
A|Yeah,|aa|3469
A|absolutely.|aa|3469
A|I think a lot of times we take, you know, basically who we want to|sv|3469
A|because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get in.|sv|3469
B|Exactly.|aa|3469
B|Connections and money.|^2|3469
A|Yeah,|aa|3469
A|and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent, you know. And that it should be equal to all|sv|3469
B|Yeah.|b|3469
A|and then not like the United States,|sv|3469
A|basically, it's not who you know,|sv|3469
A|it it doesn't become a thing of who you know, but, but how the type of person you are.|sv|3469
B|I agree.|aa|3469
A|And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like probably your husband, can get in|sv|3469
B|Yeah|b|3469
B|Well, we got him past that,|sd|3469
B|but, uh,|%|3469
A|Well, great.|ba|3469
B|I know there's a lot of other people out there, would probably do a good job here.|sv|3469
A|Yep.|b|3469
A|Well, let's see,|^h|3469
A|is there anything I believe in|qy|3469
B|I think that's it.|sv|3469
B|Is this like a very short call?|qy|3469
A|No,|nn|3469
A|I'm not sure how long they're supposed to be,|sd|3469
A|but, I've enjoyed it.|sd|3469
A|It's good hearing your, your point of view|sd|3469
A|and I think that's neat.|sv|3469
A|I think we agree a lot on that|sv|3469
A|and I've learned something from it.|sd|3469
B|I did, too.|aa|3469
B|Well, it was nice talking to you.|fc|3469
A|Well, thanks,|ft|3469
A|I'm glad you're home.|fc|3469
A|You have a good evening, all right?|fc|3469
B|You, too.|fc|3469
A|Thanks,|ft|3469
A|bye-bye.|fc|3469
B|Bye.|fc|3469
A|Well, seems to me the, one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process.|sv|3520
B|Well, I agree with the boredom of the election process,|aa|3520
B|but I also, uh, think that people don't realize that their boat, vote will make a difference.|sv|3520
B|Uh, they feel like that, you know, it's going to go however it's going to go|sv|3520
B|and their one little vote is not going to make that much difference|sv|3520
B|and it's, just why make the effort.|sd|3520
A|Well, sometimes, strangely enough, one vote has made the difference.|sv|3520
B|Well, I agree with that|aa|3520
B|and I, and I do know that, you know, all those votes are counted|sd|3520
B|and, and they do make a difference.|sv|3520
B|Uh, also I think that people have a tendency to, to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the, the more local elections.|sv|3520
A|Well, it's kind of strange|sv|3520
A|because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives.|sd|3520
B|Exactly,|aa|3520
B|and, I, I even have a tendency to do that myself.|sd|3520
B|And I have to really make a concerted effort to, to get involved.|sd|3520
B|I live, I live in a suburb in Mesquite|sd|3520
B|and, uh, so I really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me.|sd|3520
B|But I, I think on the whole, most people don't, uh, feel that way.|sv|3520
B|Or don't look, even look at that.|sv|3520
B|I think they just don't even,|sv|3520
B|I, I don't think they're conscious of it.|sv|3520
A|Well, maybe part of the problem is they don't, they think they have enough choices.|sv|3520
B|Well, that may be true, too.|sv|3520
B|I hadn't thought of that.|sd|3520
A|You know, in some of the European countries, they have numbers of parties that run|sd|3520
A|and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country.|sd|3520
B|Uh-huh,|b|3520
B|right.|b|3520
B|And sometimes it's, uh,|%|3520
B|well, not sometimes, but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign|sv|3520
B|and, and issues get, uh, bogged down.|sd|3520
A|Well, maybe it's a matter of, you know, voter awareness.|sv|3520
B|Uh, I think voter awareness,|%|3520
B|I, I did some work for the, uh, Women's League of, uh, Voters, uh, several years ago|sd|3520
B|and, I think there are some organizations that used to, uh, do some voter awareness, uh, things.|sv|3520
B|They don't get a lot of participation.|sd|3520
B|They don't get a lot of, uh, activity.|sd|3520
B|Most of the League of Women Voters, what they did was they put out information, so that it, it would just be made available to everyone.|sd|3520
B|Now, other areas that I've worked in, like in the chambers, they would just have the candidates come|sd|3520
B|and it would just, you know,|%|3520
B|that was not a lot of community involvement|sv|3520
B|and those were people that would mostly vote anyway.|sv|3520
A|Well, I think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long.|sv|3520
A|In Britain, you know, they have a set period of time|sd|3520
A|and, and for campaign, that's it.|sd|3520
A|In this country, it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign.|sv|3520
B|It's a, it's an ongoing campaign|aa|3520
B|and it's expensive campaign|sv|3520
B|and it, it, uh, eliminates a lot of qualified people.|sv|3520
B|Uh, maybe more qualified and, uh, more dedicated to the issues.|sv|3520
A|Well, the, they don't want to spend the time|sv|3520
A|or they don't have the money.|sv|3520
B|Exactly,|aa|3520
B|exactly|aa|3520
B|and it, it,|%|3520
B|I, I can't I just can't believe,|sd|3520
B|I've, I've worked in a couple of local campaigns.|sd|3520
B|I just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally.|sd|3520
A|Well, it's a matter of name recognition.|sv|3520
A|People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of.|sv|3520
B|Oh, well, I agree with that,|aa|3520
B|but also,|%|3520
B|and I, and I'm not for controlling how much is spent,|sd|3520
B|but do you know,|%|3520
B|that's one thing,|sv|3520
B|if a, if the time wasn't so,|%|3520
B|if it wasn't such a long, uh, campaigning time, then they couldn't spend as much money.|sd|3520
A|And even debates don't seem to help much.|sv|3520
B|No,|aa|3520
B|they really don't.|sv|3520
B|Uh, it's it's, a lot of it is who looks the best, who, uh, who happens to say the right thing at the right time, who, not, who may not be the most qualified and can get the uh, the job done.|sv|3520
A|So we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers.|bf|3520
B|Exactly.|aa|3520
B|And it's a, it's a lot,|%|3520
B|I've worked in public relations a lot|sd|3520
B|and, uh, that kind of thing can make and break, make or break you|sd|3520
A|Well, that was certainly a media event.|sv|3520
B|and it's just, uh, uh,|%|3520
B|he possibly could have, uh, won that election had it not been for some of the the, uh, the way he presented himself.|sv|3520
A|Well, he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease.|sv|3520
B|Hoof, is, is, I guess the right term for him.|aa|3520
B|Okay.|o_"_bc|3924
A|Uh, go ahead.|ad|3924
B|What are we supposed to discuss again?|qw|3924
A|AIDS research is something that, that, I think whether our country is putting enough money into it|sv|3924
B|More money )),|%|3924
A|and actually I'm concerned that they're not.|sd|3924
A|I have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,|sd|3924
B|Uh-huh.|b|3924
A|and one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.|sd|3924
B|Uh-huh.|b|3924
A|And these were from other, people from other countries.|sd|3924
A|He's a translator.|sd|3924
B|Uh-huh.|b|3924
A|And in talking to the people from France he said, you know,|sd|3924
A|he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is.|sd|3924
A|And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.|sv|3924
B|Huh.|b|3924
A|Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it.|sv|3924
A|So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more.|sv|3924
A|I don't know that spending more always gets it.|sv|3924
B|Yeah.|b|3924
B|I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, well it is very frightening and scary.|sv|3924
B|I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases,|sd|3924
B|and, uh, I mean whether,|%|3924
A|You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,|bf|3924
B|Yes.|aa|3924
A|yeah.|b|3924
B|And, uh, whether those diseases can|%|3924
B|some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research|sv|3924
A|Uh-huh.|b|3924
B|uh|%|3924
A|Uh-huh.|b|3924
B|didn't, uh, you know,|%|3924
B|but I, uh,|%|3924
B|then part of it's lack of education.|sv|3924
B|I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.|sv|3924
A|Well it,|%|3924
A|I, I agree with you there|aa|3924
A|because I know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one|sv|3924
A|and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.|sd|3924
B|Uh-huh.|b|3924
A|Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly,|sv|3924
A|or do they both get served?|qy|3924
A|Uh, that's a good point.|sv|3924
B|And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things.|sv|3924
B|One is preventing the spread|sd|3924
B|and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.|sd|3924
A|Uh-huh.|b|3924
B|And I'm not certain,|sd|3924
B|I, I,|%|3924
B|again this,|%|3924
B|I'm telling you,|o_"_bc|3924
B|basically I don't have any opinion.|sd|3924
A|Uh-huh.|b|3924
B|But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.|sv|3924
A|Well, and one of the things I'd,|%|3924
A|and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.|sv|3924
B|Yeah,|b|3924
B|well, you know,|%|3924
A|That's, that's the part that,|%|3924
B|t-, whether my dentist or|%|3924
A|That's the part that scares me, you know.|sv|3924
A|I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,|sd|3924
A|well no,|^q|3924
A|it's for homosexuals and gays,|^q|3924
A|well no,|^q|3924
A|actually, it's,|^q|3924
A|I mean, you know.|h|3924
A|Did they know that all along?|qh|3924
B|and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes.|sd|3924
B|And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not.|sd|3924
B|Can't get it from mosquitoes.|^q|3924
B|And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,|sd|3924
B|yes.|^q|3924
A|Oh|b|3924
B|And I don't know that's true or not.|sd|3924
B|I mean, I just heard it in passing,|sd|3924
B|but so what does that,|qw|3924
A|Right.|b|3924
B|what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and|qw|3924
A|And how is it really transmitted, et cetera.|qw|3924
B|Yeah.|b|3924
A|Which is, I think, what they also don't know.|sv|3924
A|I mean that's,|%|3924
A|I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.|sv|3924
B|Uh-huh.|b|3924
A|It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,|sv|3924
A|but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.|sd|3924
B|No.|aa|3924
A|In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,|sd|3924
A|and it's huge over there.|sd|3924
A|So I, I, you know,|%|3924
A|and it's beginning, other countries|%|3924
A|that's what's his point.|sd|3924
A|This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.|sd|3924
B|Uh-huh.|b|3924
A|And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?|qh|3924
B|Oh.|b|3924
A|I mean I don't know.|sd|3924
A|All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.|sv|3924
A|Uh, or maybe they understand but,|sv|3924
B|I think maybe more information should be given out about it.|sv|3924
A|Yeah,|b|3924
A|and, uh, and then the people that have it,|sd|3924
A|it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back.|sv|3924
A|If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.|sv|3924
B|I, I, give me cyanide.|ad|3924
B|I mean, is it )),|%|3924
A|Yeah,|b|3924
A|right.|b|3924
A|I'll take anything you know.|sd|3924
B|Uh-huh.|b|3924
A|I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me.|sv|3924
B|Ri-,|%|3924
B|Exactly.|aa|3924
A|Go ahead.|ad|3924
B|And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,|qh|3924
A|Exactly.|aa|3924
B|let them, do it.|ad|3924
A|Yeah.|b|3924
A|Yeah.|b|3924
A|And that's what I think they're saying too.|sv|3924
B|Have you had any snow up your way?|qy|3936
A|No,|nn|3936
A|we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas|sd|3936
A|and, uh we had a lot before Christmas.|sd|3936
B|Um.|b|3936
A|The ski resorts were really|sd|3936
A|and, uh,|%|3936
A|but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,|sd|3936
A|so,|%|3936
A|but no, uh, no snow.|ng|3936
B|Um.|b|3936
A|The snows all melted off uh,|sd|3936
B|Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend|sd|3936
B|and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way.|sd|3936
A|Uh-huh,|b|3936
A|I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,|sv|3936
A|but not,|%|3936
A|usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts|sd|3936
A|and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches.|sd|3936
B|Um|b|3936
A|At this time of the year,|sd|3936
A|and we've been in a drought for the last five years|sd|3936
A|and this is the sixth year|sd|3936
A|and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer.|sv|3936
B|Yeah,|b|3936
B|well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas.|sd|3936
A|Right.|b|3936
B|But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,|sd|3936
B|but we have our share of cold weather as well.|sd|3936
B|The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing.|sd|3936
B|It didn't stay there,|sd|3936
B|but it was right at,|sd|3936
A|Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?|qy|3936
A|Um.|b|3936
B|We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,|sd|3936
B|but this year it wasn't bad at all.|sv|3936
B|I guess that's because we had so much rain.|sv|3936
A|I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.|sd|3936
A|He said it was just,|sd|3936
A|and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,|sd|3936
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3936
A|and, uh,|%|3936
B|Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston|sd|3936
B|and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,|sd|3936
B|and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course.|sd|3936
A|Oh, boy.|ba|3936
B|They have a, uh, lake cabin|sd|3936
B|and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake.|sd|3936
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba|3936
B|So we really had a lot of rain.|sd|3936
A|Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,|sd|3936
A|there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano|sd|3936
B|Right.|b|3936
A|and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,|sd|3936
A|and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,|sd|3936
A|but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess.|sd|3936
A|It just|%|3936
B|Yeah,|b|3936
B|we had a lot of flash floods in the area.|sd|3936
B|We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few.|sd|3936
A|Uh-huh.|b|3936
B|Not more than ten|sd|3936
B|but,|%|3936
A|That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much.|sv|3936
B|Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,|sd|3936
B|it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy|^q|3936
A|Yeah,|b|3936
A|well, it's, uh, interesting,|sv|3936
A|uh,|%|3936
A|I'm going down to El Paso next week|sd|3936
A|and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,|sd|3936
A|but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,|sv|3936
B|Well, El Paso won't be cold.|ar|3936
A|It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?|qy|3936
B|No,|nn|3936
B|it's, it's, quite southern|sd|3936
B|and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso.|sd|3936
A|Uh-huh.|b|3936
B|The, uh, you'll be flying in there?|qy^d|3936
A|Yes.|ny|3936
B|Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,|sv|3936
B|the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain, the Rockies|sd|3936
A|Yes.|b|3936
B|and they're towering above you|sd|3936
B|and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again.|sd|3936
A|Yeah,|b|3936
A|we're kind of used to that here in Utah,|sd|3936
A|course, there are mountains,|sd|3936
A|and I fly into Montana a lot|sd|3936
A|and we have a,|%|3936
A|the mountains are, are really, uh, high|sd|3936
A|and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh,|sd|3936
A|it's in the little valley,|sd|3936
A|but, I, uh, sure hope we,|sd|3936
A|we really need the moisture.|sv|3936
A|I hope we can get, uh, get some.|sd|3936
A|There's supposed to be a storm,|sd|3936
A|but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah|sd|3936
A|and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here|sd|3936
A|so,|%|3936
B|Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,|sd|3936
B|but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?|qy|3936
A|Yeah,|b|3936
A|well, that's, that's what the,|%|3936
A|above, uh,|%|3936
A|some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana,|sd|3936
A|so that just left us,|sd|3936
A|we got a high pressure system which been sitting in the|sd|3936
B|Huh.|b|3936
A|and, uh, we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had, uh, you know|sd|3936
B|Oh, boy.|ba|3936
A|airport's been shut down, uh, till about noon every day|sd|3936
A|and then they seed the clouds, or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out.|sd|3936
B|Uh-huh.|b|3936
B|Huh.|b|3936
B|Well, we, uh, had a bad siege last, uh, Christmas a year ago.|sd|3936
B|We went up to visit my wife's, uh, sister who lives in, uh, Calgary, Alberta, Can,|sd|3936
A|Okay.|o_"_bc|3968
B|All right.|b|3968
B|That's a real different topic.|sv|3968
B|I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy.|sv|3968
A|I know.|aa|3968
A|I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about.|sv|3968
A|See, I'm a college student,|sd|3968
A|so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that.|sd|3968
B|Yeah.|b|3968
A|But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic.|sv|3968
B|Yeah.|b|3968
B|I think, personally, you know,|sv|3968
B|I'm, I used to be a college student ten years ago|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you.|sv|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
A|Oh, golly.|ba|3968
A|You're like, No, you don't, no.|sd|3968
B|It's like, how do you know my name,|sd|3968
B|where did you get my phone number,|^q|3968
B|and why do you think it's a deal for me?|^q|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit|sv|3968
A|Yeah.|b|3968
B|and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think.|sv|3968
A|They call late,|sv|3968
A|now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or|sd|3968
B|Oh, they do already.|sd|3968
A|See, that's|%|3968
A|I would be so mad|sd|3968
B|Well,|b|3968
B|and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too.|sd|3968
A|Really.|bh|3968
B|Uh-huh.|ny|3968
A|Huh.|b|3968
B|But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.|sd|3968
A|How?|qw|3968
B|Don't answer your phone, Hello.|ad|3968
B|The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello.|sd|3968
A|Really?|bh|3968
B|Uh-huh.|ny|3968
A|Huh.|b|3968
A|I don't know,|h|3968
A|I think like things that, that|%|3968
A|I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically.|sv|3968
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3968
A|That drives me up a wall.|sd|3968
B|Are you and your roommate a similar size.|qy|3968
A|No,|nn|3968
A|see, we're not,|sd|3968
A|and, uh.|%|3968
B|And she still goes through your clothes?|qy^d|3968
A|Yeah,|ny|3968
A|she'll take all my shirts and stuff,|sd|3968
A|because she can't wear like my pants|sd|3968
B|Uh-huh.|b|3968
A|but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.|sd|3968
B|Ooh.|ba|3968
A|Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know.|sd|3968
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3968
A|But still, she'll just take them,|sd|3968
A|and she won't even think about it,|sd|3968
A|and then, I'll like see her that day,|sd|3968
A|and she'll be wearing my clothes,|sd|3968
A|and I'll be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know,|sd|3968
A|I really don't.|sd|3968
A|So I prefer that you just not go in and get them|^q|3968
B|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|Uh-huh.|b|3968
A|because she doesn't even ask me.|sd|3968
A|Stuff like that really|sd|3968
A|like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like.|sv|3968
B|Oh, yeah,|aa|3968
B|I agree.|aa|3968
A|Stuff like that,|sd|3968
A|when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that.|sd|3968
B|Uh-huh.|b|3968
A|I was thinking like my mom.|sd|3968
A|I know this,|sd|3968
A|she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff|sd|3968
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3968
A|we always just give her her purse, you know,|sd|3968
A|and she'll get it out or whatever.|sd|3968
B|Yeah.|b|3968
B|Uh-huh.|b|3968
A|I was trying to think,|^h|3968
A|I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.|sd|3968
B|My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.|sd|3968
A|Really.|b|3968
B|I mean, we're all grown,|sd|3968
B|all her kids are grown,|sd|3968
B|and we have our own families|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?|sd|3968
A|Yeah,|b|3968
A|get out of my cabinets.|bf|3968
B|Like, what are you doing?|sd|3968
B|Don't you have your own house to dig through?|^q|3968
A|That's great.|ba|3968
B|Yeah,|b|3968
B|so, I guess, privacy is really,|%|3968
B|and at the work place, I suppose,|sv|3968
B|oh, well, actually yes.|aa|3968
B|I can say definitely, privacy at the work place.|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk|sd|3968
A|See.|b|3968
A|Yeah.|b|3968
B|because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,|sd|3968
B|and I could tell I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way.|sd|3968
A|You could tell,|bf|3968
A|you know you put your stuff where it's,|bf|3968
A|Yeah.|aa|3968
A|That would drive, that would, that|sd|3968
B|It would drive, it drove me batty for a while.|sd|3968
A|Really.|bh|3968
B|Yeah,|ny|3968
B|well, I worked a second shift|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|and everybody else in my area worked first shift|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|and our shifts overlapped|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|so I would come in,|sd|3968
B|and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,|sd|3968
B|and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,|sd|3968
B|it's my vitamins,|sd|3968
B|I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,|sd|3968
B|why are they working at my desk,|^q|3968
B|and can I have it back.|^q|3968
A|Yeah.|b|3968
B|Can I have it back soon, maybe.|^q|3968
A|Then you start missing stuff,|qy^d|3968
A|and.|%|3968
B|Oh, yeah,|ny|3968
B|no mommy is going to take the vitamins,|sd|3968
B|I'm sorry,|h|3968
B|I have|%|3968
A|That's okay.|bd|3968
A|See that would, that would make me really mad,|sd|3968
A|because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,|sv|3968
A|just because,|%|3968
A|I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way|sd|3968
A|and you know how it looks and everything.|sv|3968
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3968
B|Well, you know how you left it the day before.|sv|3968
A|Uh-huh. child_talking|b|3968
A|That would bother me, definitely.|sd|3968
B|Oh, yeah,|aa|3968
B|so, that's, child_talking|%|3968
B|yeah,|aa|3968
B|I agree,|aa|3968
B|it's, it's pretty tough that way,|sv|3968
B|and, I know, even like with your school books and papers.|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|Do you miss your papers sometimes?|qy|3968
A|See,|%|3968
A|yeah.|ny|3968
B|Uh-huh.|b|3968
A|You know.|%|3968
A|That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though.|sd|3968
B|Yeah,|b|3968
B|well, actually I do know,|sd|3968
B|and I have used it once|sd|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,|sv|3968
B|but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address.|sd|3968
A|Oh, really?|bh|3968
B|Yeah.|ny|3968
A|Uh-huh.|b|3968
B|And that,|%|3968
B|I mean, I've, I've used it once,|sd|3968
B|Okay|o_"_bc|4002
A|Okay|b^m|4002
B|Have you done this very long?|qy|4002
A|Uh, well, yeah,|ny|4002
A|for the last, uh, couple of months.|sd|4002
B|Yeah,|b|4002
B|that's the same with us.|sd|4002
A|Yeah.|b|4002
B|Well, what kind of car would you buy?|qw|4002
A|Well, it's kind of hard to say,|^h|4002
A|uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years.|sd|4002
A|We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine|sd|4002
B|Oh, okay.|bk|4002
A|and, uh,|%|4002
A|wait a minute,|^h|4002
A|we bought one in ninety.|sd|4002
A|We've got three cars, of all things.|sd|4002
B|Uh-huh.|b|4002
A|So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan.|sd|4002
B|Okay.|b|4002
B|What kind do you have now?|qw|4002
A|Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X.|sd|4002
B|Oh, okay.|bk|4002
A|Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,|sv|4002
A|we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have|sd|4002
B|Uh-huh.|b|4002
A|and then, of course, we look into the prices.|sd|4002
B|Yeah.|b|4002
A|And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted|sd|4002
A|because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time.|sd|4002
A|Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda.|sd|4002
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b|4002
A|So, uh,|%|4002
B|And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?|qy|4002
A|Uh, yeah,|ny|4002
A|yeah.|ny|4002
A|We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,|sd|4002
A|and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars.|sd|4002
B|Uh-huh.|b|4002
A|And, uh, they, they, uh,|%|4002
A|I've been extremely,|sd|4002
A|we've had three Mazdas.|sd|4002
A|We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.|sd|4002
B|Oh, really?|bh|4002
A|Yeah.|ny|4002
B|We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles.|sd|4002
A|Yeah,|b|4002
A|well, we, we've had, uh,|%|4002
A|let's see,|^h|4002
A|we had, uh, we had a, uh,|sd|4002
A|let me think.|^h|4002
A|ause We had a fifty-three|sd|4002
A|and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story|sd|4002
A|Uh, and we had a sixty-five|sd|4002
A|and then we had this eighty-two.|sd|4002
B|Uh-huh.|b|4002
A|So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really.|sd|4002
B|Yeah,|b|4002
B|we've been real pleased with ours.|sd|4002
B|I think we've had, one, two, three|sd|4002
A|Yeah.|b|4002
B|and most,|%|4002
B|we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven.|sd|4002
A|Uh-huh.|b|4002
B|Then we have a Cutlass Sierra|sd|4002
B|and we've had the ninety-eight.|sd|4002
A|Uh-huh.|b|4002
B|So,|%|4002
B|but I don't know,|h|4002
B|we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year|sd|4002
B|and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company.|sd|4002
A|Uh-huh.|b|4002
A|Uh-huh.|b|4002
B|But, I don't know what we're going to buy.|sd|4002
B|I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,|sv|4002
B|but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty|sd|4002
A|Well|b|4002
B|So,|%|4002
A|uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years|sd|4002
A|and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.|sd|4002
B|Oh.|b|4002
A|Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M G B|sd|4002
B|Oh the,|%|4002
A|Was British racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top.|sd|4002
B|Ooh, boy.|ba|4002
A|And, uh, I drove it mostly.|sd|4002
B|I'll bet it was hard to part with that.|sv|4002
A|And,|%|4002
A|Yeah,|aa|4002
A|it really was.|aa|4002
A|My husband was in the Air Force|sd|4002
A|and we got transferred to Okinawa.|sd|4002
B|Oh.|b|4002
A|So, uh, we had to sell it.|sd|4002
A|which really tore me up|sd|4002
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4002
A|Because, uh, it, it it was great fun.|sv|4002
A|And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand,|sd|4002
A|we, uh, we decided that, uh,|sd|4002
A|we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile|sd|4002
A|and it, and it was just too big,|sd|4002
A|so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States|sd|4002
A|and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan.|sd|4002
B|Oh.|b|4002
A|So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale?|qo|4102
B|Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for.|sv|4102
A|Uh-huh.|b|4102
B|They've got a lot of special needs|sv|4102
B|and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have.|sv|4102
A|Right,|aa|4102
A|very definitely.|aa|4102
B|And so you've got a real balance to make there.|sv|4102
A|Uh-huh.|b|4102
B|What about you?|qo|4102
A|Well, I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old.|sd|4102
A|They aren't really that old,|sd|4102
A|but they are, sort of wearing out.|sd|4102
A|My mamma is a dialysis patient|sd|4102
B|Uh-huh.|b|4102
A|and she is only about sixty-four,|sd|4102
A|but she's had some pretty close calls|sd|4102
A|and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now|sd|4102
A|and so she's phasing out ounds like|sd|4102
A|and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when she wants to|sd|4102
B|Uh-huh.|b|4102
A|uh, I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home,|sd|4102
A|but my daddy keeps talking about it.|sd|4102
A|I don't,|%|4102
A|I couldn't possibly, couldn't never see him in a nursing home.|sd|4102
B|ery faint.|%|4102
A|And my grand daddy also doesn't like, wouldn't want to be in a nursing home.|sd|4102
A|He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now|sd|4102
B|Oh really.|b|4102
A|and he's living by himself.|sd|4102
A|My grand mamma died a couple of years ago|sd|4102
B|Oh, okay.|b|4102
A|so but, he's, you know,|%|4102
A|as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home.|sv|4102
B|Yeah,|b|4102
B|but it gets hard.|sv|4102
B|My, my grandmother is in her mid eighties|sd|4102
A|Uh-huh.|b|4102
B|and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease|sd|4102
A|Uh-huh.|b|4102
B|so she doesn't remember anybody|sd|4102
A|Right.|b|4102
B|and, uh, she remembers things,|sd|4102
B|but they are things back whenever she was real young|sd|4102
A|Right.|b|4102
B|and so, with,|%|4102
B|she was living by herself|sd|4102
B|but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her|sd|4102
A|Uh-huh.|b|4102
B|and it's creating a lot of problems.|sd|4102
A|Right,|b|4102
A|especially for your uncle I bet.|qy^d|4102
B|Oh yes.|ny|4102
B|Yes.|ny|4102
A|Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.|sd|4102
A|Do they have anything like that in Dallas.|qy|4102
B|In Dallas,|^h|4102
B|uh, yeah.|ny|4102
B|I've, I've heard of several things|sd|4102
B|and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,|sv|4102
B|but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up.|sv|4102
A|Right.|b|4102
A|So they are pretty limited.|bf|4102
B|Right.|aa|4102
A|Oh, another interesting thing,|sv|4102
A|another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities.|sd|4102
B|Oh really.|b|4102
B|Uh-huh.|b|4102
A|I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be.|sv|4102
B|Uh-huh,|b|4102
B|uh-huh.|b|4102
B|Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know|sv|4102
B|and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,|sv|4102
B|but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them|sv|4102
A|Uh-huh ery faint.|b|4102
A|Right.|b|4102
B|and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off|sv|4102
A|Uh-huh.|b|4102
B|because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.|sd|4102
A|Right|b|4102
A|to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities.|sd|4102
B|Right.|b|4102
B|Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas.|sd|4102
B|Uh, and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports.|sd|4102
A|Right.|aa|4102
A|Right.|aa|4102
B|But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly,|sd|4102
A|That's true.|aa|4102
A|You can't play those things.|bf|4102
B|Yeah,|aa|4102
B|you can't do it.|sd|4102
A|But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times.|sv|4102
B|Well, that's true.|aa|4102
A|I guess, you know, you were talking about your,|sd|4102
A|was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh, being able to tell old stories.|qy|4102
B|Uh-huh.|ny|4102
B|Uh-huh.|ny|4102
A|You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.|sv|4102
B|And they love to recollect.|sd|4102
B|I mean they just, you know,|%|4102
B|and they will just go on and on with these stories|sd|4102
B|and they have such a memory.|sd|4102
A|Do they like to listen to other people recollect though?|qy|4102
B|My grandmother doesn't|ng|4102
B|She, she wants to to tell you about her story over again|sd|4102
B|so|%|4102
A|Right.|b|4102
B|which is fine, you know,|sv|4102
B|so,|%|4102
A|Well, that is good because we,|sv|4102
A|Um, so what do you think?|qo|4157
B|Um,|^h|4157
B|I lived, I lived in Sweden for two years.|sd|4157
A|Uh-huh.|b|4157
B|And in Sweden they have socialized medicine.|sd|4157
B|And so I saw some of the good|sd|4157
B|and also I saw some of the bad that results from such a program.|sd|4157
A|Uh-huh.|b|4157
B|Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care.|sv|4157
A|Right.|b|4157
B|So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,|sv|4157
B|I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that, you know, there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life.|sv|4157
A|Right.|b|4157
B|Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me|sv|4157
B|because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see.|sv|4157
B|One, one thing that I noticed is it's very, very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden.|sv|4157
A|Oh, really?|bh|4157
B|Because it's treated as a disease.|sd|4157
B|Now I don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine,|sd|4157
B|but, uh, if you're, if you're alcoholic, then you're treated as if you're on disability, long-term disability|sd|4157
B|and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that.|sv|4157
A|Huh.|b|4157
B|Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,|sv|4157
B|I was, uh, I would go down all these, uh, uh,|sd|4157
B|I remember this one row of houses|sd|4157
B|and they were, uh, row houses or townhouses, all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing.|sd|4157
A|Uh-huh.|b|4157
B|Well, it would be lower middle-class housing here.|sv|4157
B|It's probably middle-class housing there.|sv|4157
A|Uh-huh.|b|4157
B|Um, and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these|sd|4157
B|and there was a doctor that lived in one of these.|sd|4157
B|The one guy was a doctor|sd|4157
B|and one was a taxi driver,|sd|4157
B|and so their, their incomes were about the same.|sd|4157
A|Huh.|b|4157
B|Whereas here, there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward.|sv|4157
A|Right.|b|4157
B|And that, that didn't exist in Sweden.|sd|4157
A|Right.|b|4157
B|And, uh, overall I their, their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower|sv|4157
B|and it was, it was less professional|sv|4157
B|and it was treated more, like a, like a taxi driver type job, then a, then a doctor type job.|sv|4157
A|Yeah.|b|4157
A|that is, uh, that is something I've heard.|aa|4157
A|Uh, I had a friend, uh, that I worked with that was from Sweden|sd|4157
A|and that was, uh,|%|4157
A|probably the, the major concern I have is that, you know, we are leading in the technology realm of, of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to, to get into, uh, the medical field,|sv|4157
A|but at the same time it's real hard.|sv|4157
A|I mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance|sd|4157
A|and so, you know, I'm real, you know,|%|4157
A|it's like well, you know, you know,|%|4157
A|there's got to be better ways, you know, to do some things|sv|4157
A|but, you know, I hate to, uh,|sd|4157
A|the, the competition, in a lot of ways is, is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor|sv|4157
A|and, and, uh, they have to compete to be, to be good and to be knowledgeable.|sd|4157
A|But at the same time, there's a, you know, they're regulating themselves|sv|4157
A|and, and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for.|sv|4157
A|My, I have a brother who's a vet|sd|4157
A|and for something that he can get, you know, wholesale|sd|4157
A|and I'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they, they, hospitals buy in such a bulk rate, um|sv|4157
B|Right.|b|4157
A|you know, they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item|sv|4157
A|and that's ridiculous.|sv|4157
A|And I don't think that is, that is, uh, abnormal in any means to be doing things like that.|sv|4157
A|And,|%|4157
B|You don't think it's abnormal?|qy^d|4157
A|I don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all|sv|4157
B|Oh, I see.|b|4157
B|You're not saying it's right,|bf|4157
B|you're just saying it's common.|bf|4157
A|yeah.|aa|4157
A|And so it's, I think, to me I think, uh, something that's going to help our medical, uh, arena is for, um,|sv|4157
A|and I don't know how to, I don't know how to do this|sd|4157
A|but I think people are too lawsuit happy.|sv|4157
A|And I mean things will happen|sv|4157
A|and, and you've got to, uh, keep up|sv|4157
A|or you've got to realize that, you know, it is just men or women that are, that are making, um, decisions|sv|4157
A|and they will make mistakes|sv|4157
A|and you know, if people, you know,|%|4157
A|there are some people that I'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it,|sv|4157
A|but there are other things that just happen that you can't, you know, you can't say, you know, well, if you had just done this, you know, things would have done differently,|sv|4157
A|and, um, I don't know.|h|4157
A|I, I think the fact that malpractice has gone up I think has raised our prices just dramatically. Um, in the, in the last number of years|sv|4157
B|Yes.|aa|4157
A|and I think that's something that if, if they could work on the cause of that and,|sv|4157
A|it's, uh,|%|4167
A|I'll start off here.|co_cc|4167
A|Uh, I don't know.|h|4167
A|I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N.|sd|4167
A|Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,|sd|4167
A|well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour|sd|4167
A|but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule|sv|4167
B|Right,|b|4167
B|yeah.|b|4167
A|and, uh,|%|4167
A|but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,|sv|4167
B|Yeah.|b|4167
B|I, I think I'd agree.|aa|4167
B|A, a similar method of getting the news with me too.|sd|4167
B|It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years.|sd|4167
B|Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts.|sv|4167
A|Right.|b|4167
B|Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature|sv|4167
B|and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth.|sv|4167
A|Uh-huh.|b|4167
A|Right.|b|4167
A|Yeah.|b|4167
A|I know, the,|%|4167
A|my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada.|sv|4167
A|Uh,|%|4167
B|That, that's true, you know.|aa|4167
B|You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries.|sd|4167
A|Uh-huh.|b|4167
A|Yeah.|b|4167
B|Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them.|sd|4167
A|Right.|b|4167
A|Yeah.|b|4167
A|I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything|sd|4167
A|and, uh, it's amazing that,|sv|4167
A|you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,|sd|4167
A|I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.|sd|4167
B|Yeah.|b|4167
A|Uh, you know.|%|4167
B|I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas|sd|4167
B|and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>.|sd|4167
B|You just, never see, you just never see anything about it,|sd|4167
B|uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,|sv|4167
B|and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand.|sv|4167
B|And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S|sv|4167
A|Uh-huh.|b|4167
B|and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico.|sv|4167
A|Yeah,|aa|4167
A|definitely.|aa|4167
B|You just don't know what's going on.|sv|4167
A|Yeah.|b|4167
B|I'd, I,|%|4167
B|every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas|sd|4167
B|and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C|sd|4167
B|and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too.|sv|4167
B|You you can tune into some stations|sd|4167
A|Uh-huh.|b|4167
B|and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events.|sd|4167
B|Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area|sd|4167
B|and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>.|sd|4167
B|There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.|sd|4167
A|Right.|b|4167
B|Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries.|sv|4167
B|I hadn't really thought about it|sd|4167
B|but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.|sv|4167
A|Right.|aa|4167
A|Exactly.|aa|4167
A|Yeah.|aa|4167
A|I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada.|sd|4167
A|Uh, well part of it, touring.|sd|4167
A|And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on.|sv|4167
A|There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec|sd|4167
B|Yeah.|b|4167
A|and I had never heard any of that before.|sd|4167
B|Yeah,|b|4167
B|you know, there was, a, a,|%|4167
B|what is it called,|qw|4167
B|is it Meech Lake Accord?|qy|4167
A|Uh-huh.|ny|4167
B|Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of|sv|4167
B|and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it.|sd|4167
B|And, and came|%|4167
B|it was a big thing going on there|sd|4167
B|and I came back here|sd|4167
B|and nothing in the papers.|sd|4167
A|Right,|b|4167
A|right.|b|4167
B|I didn't see a thing about it.|sd|4167
B|So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess.|sv|4167
B|It's improved.|sv|4167
B|And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news.|sd|4167
B|Even, even there's, uh, uh,|%|4167
B|it's it's semireligious in some respects.|sd|4167
B|But what is it?|qw|4167
B|It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,|sd|4167
B|uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel.|sd|4167
B|The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR.|sd|4167
A|Oh, yeah.|b|4167
B|Uh, I, it surprised me.|sd|4167
B|I've caught it a few times|sd|4167
B|and they, they do some pretty good news.|sd|4167
B|Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts.|sd|4167
B|Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising.|sv|4167
A|Uh-huh.|b|4167
B|You'd think it would carry mostly religious|sv|4167
B|but it, it doesn't seem to.|sv|4167
B|So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering.|sd|4167
B|Uh, some more interest type topics in, in other countries.|sd|4167
B|But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too.|sv|4167
A|Yeah.|b|4167
A|Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show.|sd|4167
A|I used to get the, uh,|sd|4167
A|A, uh, Golden Retriever.|sd|4179
B|Ooh, that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs.|sd|4179
A|Yeah.|b|4179
A|Is it really?|bh|4179
B|How long have you had it?|qw|4179
A|We've had him for,|sd|4179
A|let's see, he just had his fourth birthday.|sd|4179
B|Fourth birthday.|b^m|4179
A|Yeah,|b|4179
A|and we got him when he was about eight weeks old|sd|4179
A|and, uh, he's pretty okay,|sd|4179
A|we like him.|sd|4179
B|Does he shed a lot?|qy|4179
A|He does.|na|4179
A|That's the one thing we don't like about him.|sd|4179
A|In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off.|sd|4179
A|He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.|sv|4179
B|How much does he weigh now?|qw|4179
A|He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,|sd|4179
A|and they put him on the scale|sd|4179
A|and he's up to ninety four now.|sd|4179
B|Oh.|b|4179
A|But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever.|sd|4179
A|He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier.|sd|4179
B|Um.|b|4179
A|But,|%|4179
B|Is he good with family?|qy|4179
A|He is.|na|4179
A|It's, uh, just me and my wife|sd|4179
A|and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids.|sd|4179
A|We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.|sd|4179
B|Yeah,|b|4179
B|I can understand that|sd|4179
A|Because I,|%|4179
A|Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids|sv|4179
B|Uh-huh.|b|4179
A|How about you?|qo|4179
B|Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old.|sd|4179
A|Oh.|b|4179
B|And he's our spoiled child right now, too|sd|4179
A|Uh-huh.|b|4179
B|And he also sheds a lot.|sd|4179
A|Yeah.|b|4179
B|But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday.|sd|4179
B|But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog|sd|4179
A|That's probably a good idea.|sv|4179
A|They're good though.|sv|4179
A|Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?|qy|4179
B|No,|nn|4179
B|but my husband had one when he was growing up.|sd|4179
A|Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs.|sv|4179
A|They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.|sv|4179
A|They like to play.|sv|4179
B|Um.|b|4179
A|Especially with the kids.|sv|4179
A|They love to play with kids.|sv|4179
B|Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?|qy|4179
A|No,|nn|4179
A|he's pretty much an inside dog.|sd|4179
B|Um.|b|4179
A|He stays in.|sd|4179
A|We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much|sv|4179
A|and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.|sd|4179
B|Oh, really?|bh|4179
A|He's really a wimp.|sd|4179
A|And when it comes to being alone,|sd|4179
A|uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,|sd|4179
A|but he does not like to be tied outside.|sd|4179
A|He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark.|sd|4179
B|Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?|qy|4179
A|No,|nn|4179
A|he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well|sd|4179
A|and, uh, he knows where our yard is|sd|4179
A|and we have a pretty small yard,|sd|4179
A|but he seems to know the boundaries.|sv|4179
B|Um.|b|4179
A|And he usually is good about staying within them,|sd|4179
A|although our next door neighbors have a dog, too|sd|4179
A|and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog.|sd|4179
B|Oh, yeah?|bh|4179
A|And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff|sd|4179
A|but, he's pretty good.|sd|4179
A|He stays out of the street|sd|4179
A|and, uh, if I catch him I call him|sd|4179
A|and he comes back.|sd|4179
A|So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things.|sd|4179
B|Um.|b|4179
B|Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own|qy|4179
A|No|nn|4179
A|we never did.|sd|4179
B|and,|%|4179
A|I, I trained him on my own|sd|4179
A|and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult.|sd|4179
B|Uh-huh.|b|4179
A|We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,|sd|4179
A|but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,|sd|4179
A|so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,|sd|4179
A|but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well.|sv|4179
A|I never really to hit him or anything.|sd|4179
B|Uh-huh.|b|4179
A|Just, you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things.|sd|4179
B|Huh.|b|4179
B|Really?|bh|4179
A|I, I see other people out there|sd|4179
A|and they hit their dogs and try to,|sd|4179
A|and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing,|sd|4179
A|least I,|%|4179
B|Invisible what?|br|4179
A|Invisible fencing,|sd|4179
A|have you heard of that?|qy|4179
B|No,|nn|4179
B|what is that?|qw|4179
A|It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter|sd|4179
B|Oh.|b|4179
A|and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it|sd|4179
A|and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them.|sd|4179
B|Oh.|b|4179
B|Boy.|ba|4179
A|Yeah|b|4179
B|I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog|sd|4179
A|Yeah,|b|4179
A|well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog|sd|4179
A|and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to|sd|4179
A|so he held on to the collar|sd|4179
A|and he walked out to the perimeter.|sd|4179
A|He said it was a good jolt.|sd|4179
B|Oh, really?|bh|4179
A|Yeah,|ny|4179
A|and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those sorts of training techniques.|sv|4179
B|Um.|b|4179
A|I don't think they're always necessary.|sv|4179
A|If you put enough patience into,|sv|4179
B|Yeah,|aa|4179
B|just be consistent and diligent with it|bf|4179
A|Uh-huh.|aa|4179
B|and, um,|%|4179
A|It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?|qy|4179
B|Yeah|ny|4179
B|he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months.|sd|4179
A|Somebody just told me that|sd|4179
B|Yeah.|b|4179
A|because of the leukemia?|qy^d|4179
B|Yeah,|ny|4179
B|that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up.|sv|4179
B|And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years|sd|4179
A|Wow.|ba|4179
B|So,|%|4179
A|Quite a difference.|bf|4179
B|Yeah.|aa|4179
A|What, uh, what kind of climate do you have?|qw|4179
B|Well, uh, it's, we just moved recently|sd|4179
B|so now we're in the, uh, Dallas area|sd|4179
B|and it's very very nice|sd|4179
A|Oh.|b|4179
B|and,|%|4179
A|The only experience I have,|sd|4384
A|I don't have any children|sd|4384
A|but I've, uh, I was a baby-sitter in high school.|sd|4384
A|And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked.|sd|4384
A|And I just, uh ...|%|4384
B|<talking> Yeah.|b|4384
B|That's the only thing I've ever done also, is baby-sit.|sd|4384
A|Is it? ery faint.|qy|4384
B|But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care.|sd|4384
B|Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers.|sv|4384
A|Oh, yeah.|aa|4384
A|The expense.|sd|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Having to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock|^2|4384
B|or it's five dollars for every minute you're late. And stuff like that|sd|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
B|Which is understandable.|sv|4384
B|I mean, these people can't, you know, stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late|sv|4384
A|Just sit around|^2|4384
A|That that's true.|aa|4384
B|but|%|4384
A|See the lady I did it for,|sd|4384
A|that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.|sd|4384
A|So she could sleep in.|sd|4384
A|And, uh, then she could be at home|sd|4384
A|and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.|sd|4384
A|But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour|sd|4384
A|and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents|sd|4384
A|and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.|sd|4384
B|Oh, no.|ba|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|It's hardly worth your time.|sv|4384
A|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Yeah.|b^m|4384
B|That's pretty bad.|sv|4384
B|The only time I baby-sat was in high school|sd|4384
B|and it, you know,|%|4384
B|of course you don't|%|4384
B|I didn't pay taxes on that,|sd|4384
B|so.|%|4384
A|Right.|b|4384
B|It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,|sv|4384
B|it was these people that lived in our neighborhood|sd|4384
B|and I'd just go over there.|sd|4384
B|Every Thursday night, they went to the theater.|sd|4384
B|They had permanent tickets|sd|4384
B|and they'd give me,|sd|4384
B|it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,|sd|4384
B|but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.|sd|4384
A|Oh, wow.|ba|4384
B|And, I mean, they'd, you know,|%|4384
B|it was great.|sv|4384
B|I'd go over there|sd|4384
B|and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here.|sd|4384
B|Watch, whatever you want.|^q|4384
B|And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard.|^q|4384
B|And there's some Coke|^q|4384
B|and you know, just help yourself to anything.|^q|4384
B|So it was, it was, you know, the best,|sv|4384
A|Wow.|ba|4384
B|that was a long time ago|sd|4384
B|and that was only for a few years.|sd|4384
B|Just once a week.|sd|4384
A|Yeah.|b|4384
B|But I don't know.|h|4384
A|I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.|sv|4384
B|Oh, yeah.|aa|4384
B|That's true.|aa|4384
A|And they stick around for longer.|sv|4384
A|Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it.|sd|4384
A|And I quit you know.|sd|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|I was just like but I'm wasting my time.|sd|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|I really liked the little girl and everything|sd|4384
A|but I thought ...|sd|4384
B|She does take up,|^2|4384
B|and they do take up a lot of your time.|sv|4384
B|That ...|%|4384
A|Yeah.|aa|4384
A|Yeah,|aa|4384
A|I ...|%|4384
B|They're very demanding|sv|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
A|Well, and she was really spoiled.|sd|4384
A|They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.|sd|4384
A|So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch.|sd|4384
A|And the mom was a dentist|sd|4384
A|and I was just like, we've got to quit this.|sd|4384
A|And she's like no I don't want her to starve.|sd|4384
A|But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat|^q|4384
B|Oh, shoot.|ba|4384
B|My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything.|sd|4384
A|Eat this or <laughter>.|^2|4384
B|That's right.|aa|4384
A|So, I can see the concerns on what different people want.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|Because some,|%|4384
A|I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Uh-huh.|b|4384
A|Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.|sv|4384
B|I think,|%|4384
B|yeah,|b|4384
B|I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement.|sv|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
B|And just have like at the most, like ten kids.|sv|4384
B|And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.|sv|4384
A|No.|ar|4384
B|Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...|sv|4384
A|That's true.|aa|4384
A|I, I'd love to do it.|sd|4384
A|But I just don't trust people now.|sd|4384
A|There's too many lawsuits.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ...|sv|4384
B|More than what it's worth?|bf|4384
A|Yeah.|aa|4384
B|Yeah.|b^m|4384
A|It would scare me.|sd|4384
A|With,|%|4384
A|I don't know,|h|4384
A|cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue|sv|4384
A|but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent|sv|4384
A|and they get happy about money|sv|4384
A|and they just want to sue you.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Well, yeah.|aa|4384
B|That's,|%|4384
B|yeah,|aa|4384
B|exactly.|aa|4384
B|When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something|sv|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
A|Oh, yeah.|b|4384
B|And that's just, you know,|%|4384
B|you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time|sv|4384
A|That's impossible.|sv|4384
B|You know, you never know what they're going to get into.|sv|4384
A|I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare|sd|4384
A|and she takes her little girl with her|sd|4384
A|and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire|sd|4384
A|and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state|sd|4384
A|And that's the people that are working there, you know.|sd|4384
A|And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know.|sd|4384
B|Oh, that's horrible.|ba|4384
A|Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper.|sd|4384
B|Huh.|b|4384
A|You know, just awful things.|sd|4384
A|And so I don't know.|h|4384
A|I don't have kids|sd|4384
A|but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.|sv|4384
A|I mean, you just don't know.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|That's|%|4384
B|yeah,|b|4384
B|that's a hard thing about it.|sv|4384
B|If, I mean, I I can't foresee myself getting married|sv|4384
B|but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work.|qh|4384
B|I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either.|sv|4384
B|Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in ounds like an airplane their house that I knew well.|sv|4384
A|Oh, yeah.|aa|4384
A|That's true.|aa|4384
A|Yeah.|b|4384
B|I just, I couldn't do it I don't think.|sv|4384
A|It would just rip me apart, I think|sv|4384
A|I don't know.|h|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|Just not knowing.|sd|4384
B|Yeah,|b|4384
B|just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait.|sd|4384
A|What do you usually wear to,|qw|4622
B|Well, let's see.|^h|4622
B|It turns out that, uh,|sd|4622
B|I work at TEKTRONIX|sd|4622
B|and it's a very, uh, low key place as far as dress goes.|sd|4622
A|Uh-huh.|b|4622
B|You just wear, uh,|sd|4622
B|let's see.|^h|4622
B|When I first came here, I wore suits|sd|4622
B|but after a while I got, uh, found out that that wasn't all that important.|sd|4622
B|I'm an engineer.|sd|4622
A|Oh, I see.|b|4622
B|And, uh, so, I get to wear just, uh, how shall I say it, uh, walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking, how shall I say it, kind of like Avia, uh, walking shoes, uh,|sd|4622
A|Uh-huh.|b|4622
A|Well, that's nice comfortable stuff.|sv|4622
B|Yes.|aa|4622
B|Open shirt, open at the neck, you know, no tie.|sd|4622
A|Wow.|ba|4622
B|And, uh, just, uh, reasonable looking, how shall I say it, uh, sports clothes or some guys wear, some people even wear Levis.|sd|4622
A|Wow.|ba|4622
A|That's nice.|sv|4622
B|Now, being from Philadelphia, I don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed, right?|qy|4622
A|Well actually right now I'm a full time college student|sd|4622
A|so my dress code is very, very (( )).|ng|4622
B|Oh, okay.|bk|4622
A|Yeah,|b|4622
A|I usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime.|sd|4622
A|But over the summers I've had a job, internships with the newspaper.|sd|4622
B|Uh-huh.|b|4622
A|And that's so,|%|4622
A|generally then I dress, you know, nicer.|sd|4622
A|Usually nice summer slacks or more, sometimes skirts, stuff like that.|sd|4622
A|So, then it's still, you know, the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming out of office|sd|4622
A|but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing. To go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that|sv|4622
B|Yes.|b|4622
A|so.|%|4622
B|Yeah,|b|4622
B|well I, uh, I just recently applied for a different job in the company here|sd|4622
B|and so I decided well I'd wear a suit.|sd|4622
A|Oh, really.|b|4622
A|Uh-huh.|b|4622
B|And it, it was very interesting,|sv|4622
B|uh, like I said, most of the people at, at this company don't wear suits.|sd|4622
B|Uh, most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual, almost the same clothes that, that you'd wear to school.|sd|4622
A|Wow.|ba|4622
A|That must be nice atmosphere then.|qy^d|4622
B|Well, it has been.|na|4622
B|Although the new president and C E O of the company is from a much more formal eastern, uh, background.|sd|4622
A|Oh.|b|4622
B|And so the result is that, uh,|%|4622
B|so anyway I wore this suit|sd|4622
B|and I went over to, uh, uh, to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it|sd|4622
A|Uh-huh.|b|4622
B|and it, and I, I was almost converted because, uh, the effect of that suit on the way people reacted and responded to me as opposed to the,|sd|4622
B|uh, just to kind of,|%|4622
B|how shall I say it,|h|4622
B|they know you're there|sv|4622
B|but they don't|sv|4622
B|uh, you don't,|%|4622
B|there's no notice at all.|sv|4622
B|But when I wore a suit that day, uh, it was obvious that people didn't know whether I was a worker bee or a manager.|sd|4622
A|Wow.|ba|4622
B|So people, uh, how shall I say it, made a, made much more effort to notice you, acknowledge your presence, say hello and, uh, things like that,|sd|4622
B|so.|%|4622
A|That's interesting.|ba|4622
A|It's like a mini, little study there|sv|4622
B|Yeah.|b|4622
A|That's really interesting.|ba|4622
B|And so this dress for success thing, I think is, uh,|sv|4622
B|by and large I've, I'm kind of, uh, convinced that, uh, by that, just that one, uh, uh, experience and then having talked to several other people that, that, uh, unless you're in a, an environment where they're going to make fun of, of, of better clothes, that better clothes always pay off.|sv|4622
A|Right.|b|4622
A|Huh.|b|4622
A|That's interesting.|ba|4622
B|Doesn't mean they have to be, uh,|sd|4622
B|how shall I say it,|h|4622
B|they don't have to be the, the most, uh, the absolute best|sv|4622
A|Uh-huh.|b|4622
B|but, uh, a little dressing a little bit above the standard, I think, would, uh, pay off|sv|4622
B|so I'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again.|sd|4622
A|<Laughter> That's neat,|ba|4622
A|that's neat|ba|4622
B|And, uh, I, I don't know,|h|4622
B|now I, I know eastern,|sd|4622
B|now the other thing we do here, of course, is a single, not quite a single climate.|sd|4622
B|We have, uh, we do have some snow in the wintertime|sd|4622
B|and it can be quite warm in the summertime.|sd|4622
A|Uh-huh.|b|4622
B|Not hot like, uh,|sd|4622
B|I lived in the midwest for a while.|sd|4622
A|Oh.|b|4622
B|And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime.|sd|4622
A|Uh-huh.|b|4622
B|We don't have that much.|sd|4622
B|It's, uh, it's a very mild climate.|sd|4622
A|Oh, well that's nice.|ba|4622
A|That's good for the clothes budget, I would imagine.|qy^d|4622
B|Yes,|ny|4622
B|it is.|sd|4622
A|Because here, gosh, we had, uh,|sd|4622
A|the winter hasn't been bad this winter.|sd|4622
A|It's, it it's only snowed maybe once or twice|sd|4622
A|but it's been cold.|sd|4622
A|Low twenties, let's say,|sd|4622
A|and then the summer gets up to eighties, nineties|sd|4622
A|so,|%|4622
A|You interested in woodworking?|qy|4643
B|Yeah.|ny|4643
B|Actually, I, uh, I guess I am|sd|4643
B|Um, it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion.|sv|4643
B|Uh, I do, uh, some, uh, woodworking myself|sd|4643
B|Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son.|sd|4643
A|Um. What kind of|qw|4643
B|It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess.|sd|4643
A|pine?|qy|4643
B|But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box|sd|4643
B|and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,|sd|4643
B|the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard|sd|4643
A|Uh-huh.|b|4643
A|I guess he's young.|qy^d|4643
B|and then,|%|4643
B|yes|ny|4643
B|He's about five and a half years old.|sd|4643
A|Oh, he'll be delighted.|sv|4643
B|Oh, yeah.|aa|4643
B|Uh-huh.|aa|4643
B|Now I just have to finish it though.|sd|4643
B|I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work|sd|4643
B|and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,|sd|4643
B|because I've got it all cut out,|sd|4643
B|it's all, uh,|%|4643
B|I've done most of the coloring|sd|4643
B|but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.|sd|4643
A|Did you do it with a jigsaw|qy|4643
A|or do you have powered, you know, a,|qy|4643
B|Uh, yeah.|ny|4643
B|Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it.|sd|4643
A|Um.|b|4643
B|So yeah.|b|4643
B|to do the, uh, the turn cut.|sd|4643
B|Uh, how about yourself?|qo|4643
A|Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking.|sd|4643
A|I don't have lots of tools.|sd|4643
A|Our local schools have adult education in the evening|sd|4643
B|Oh.|b|4643
A|uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance.|sd|4643
A|I'm an artist.|sd|4643
B|Oh, okay.|b|4643
A|And I'm very handy|sd|4643
A|and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us-, usually.|sd|4643
B|That's great.|ba|4643
B|What, what type of art do you focus on?|qw|4643
A|I have a Master's degree|sd|4643
A|and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,|sd|4643
A|but I'm really interested in the crafts.|sd|4643
B|Huh.|b|4643
A|I make stain glass.|sd|4643
A|I've done some silver jewelry making|sd|4643
A|and I kind of,|sd|4643
A|once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else|sd|4643
B|Yeah.|b|4643
B|Kind of jack of all trades, master of none.|bf|4643
A|Yeah,|aa|4643
A|well no,|ar|4643
A|actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow,|sd|4643
A|you didn't buy it,|sd|4643
A|you made it.|sd|4643
B|That's great!|ba|4643
A|And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone|%|4643
A|so let's do something else.|sd|4643
B|Right.|aa|4643
B|You want to, uh, explore a new field|bf|4643
B|or, or,|%|4643
A|Well, yeah,|aa|4643
A|I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet|sd|4643
B|Huh. So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?|qw|4643
A|but,|%|4643
A|Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art|sd|4643
A|and it's in art education.|sd|4643
B|Oh, okay.|bk|4643
A|So, I'm a licensed teacher|sd|4643
A|but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach|sd|4643
B|Yeah.|b|4643
A|and that way I have time for my kids too.|sd|4643
A|And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.|sv|4643
A|I don't know how long that's going to last|sd|4643
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4643
A|And, uh, they're cutting back,|sd|4643
A|so I don't go in all that often|sd|4643
A|but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things.|sd|4643
A|Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars|sd|4643
A|and I say, oh no|sd|4643
A|and , and I go|sd|4643
A|and I make it.|sd|4643
B|Yeah.|b|4643
A|That's how I started jewelry making.|sd|4643
A|I, I love to cook.|sd|4643
B|Oh, that's great.|ba|4643
A|And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff|sd|4643
A|and I went|sd|4643
A|and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you|sd|4643
A|and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.|sd|4643
B|Exactly.|aa|4643
A|And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars|sd|4643
A|It took me a lot of time|sd|4643
A|but  it didn't,|sd|4643
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4643
A|but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,|sd|4643
A|and then I,|%|4643
B|And your time,|^2|4643
B|then you're that much farther ahead|sv|4643
A|Yeah.|b|4643
A|Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons.|sd|4643
A|It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.|sd|4643
B|Right.|b|4643
B|I've seen them|sd|4643
B|and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in|sd|4643
B|and,|sd|4643
A|Oh, yeah.|b|4643
A|Uh-huh.|b|4643
B|That's neat.|sv|4643
A|I went there,|sd|4643
A|we have Home Depot out here.|sd|4643
A|I don't know if you've heard of it.|qy^d|4643
A|I went|sd|4643
A|and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.|sd|4643
B|Yes.|ny|4643
B|We have one.|sd|4643
A|I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath|sd|4643
A|and cutting that wedge out was no joke|sd|4643
B|Huh.|b|4643
B|Oh, I'm, I'm sure.|ba|4643
A|We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd|4643
B|A band saw?|qy^d|4643
B|What?|br|4643
A|I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd|4643
B|Uh-huh.|b|4643
A|And the teacher was one of these negative people,|sd|4643
A|oh that's dangerous,|^q|4643
A|we can't do that,|^q|4643
A|we just can't do that.|^q|4643
A|And I'm going well how about this way?|sd|4643
A|I, I want to do that,|^q|4643
A|that was the plan here|^q|4643
B|Right.|b|4643
A|So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.|sd|4643
B|A cradle for it.|^2|4643
B|Yeah,|b|4643
B|so you can steady it|bf|4643
B|and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?|qy|4643
A|Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw|sd|4643
A|but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that|sd|4643
B|Right,|b|4643
B|right.|b|4643
A|and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.|sd|4643
A|I said I'm not that steady,|sd|4643
A|it's not going to happen.|^q|4643
B|Yeah.|b|4643
A|So we built a cradle for it|sd|4643
A|and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,|sd|4643
A|by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about|sd|4643
B|Right.|b|4643
A|So,|%|4643
B|Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?|qy|4643
A|Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth.|ng|4643
A|You know|%|4643
B|Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log|sd|4643
B|and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,|%|4643
B|it's, uh,|sd|4643
B|if you're looking at adding on you have,|sd|4643
A|Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution.|sd|4771
A|I think Grand Rapids was number one.|sd|4771
A|Uh, we really don't have too much of a problem as far as, uh, industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here.|sd|4771
A|But we do have the same problem a lot of other areas up here in the northeast have|sd|4771
A|and that is the effects of acid rain. coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana.|sv|4771
B|Right.|b|4771
B|Well, that's true.|aa|4771
B|Actually down here we don't have a big problem with, uh, with air pollution.|sd|4771
B|Mainly because we don't have anybody to to either side of us.|sv|4771
B|Uh, which helps out a lot as far as that goes.|sd|4771
B|I wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when I lived up in Boston and up in, uh, you know,|sd|4771
B|debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and, you know, in that area over, uh, air pollution|sd|4771
B|and their attitude's, basically, well, prevailing ins, winds are to the east|sd|4771
B|so why should we have to worry.|^q|4771
A|Yeah.|b|4771
A|I've, I've, uh, was in Los Angeles once|sd|4771
A|and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes.|sd|4771
A|I mean you couldn't really see that much|sv|4771
A|Every once in a while we have these air inversions, the weather inversions|sd|4771
B|Oh, yes|b|4771
B|nothing,|%|4771
A|and then it gets hazy around here|sd|4771
A|but they're really,|%|4771
A|we don't have a big problem with it.|sd|4771
A|I think that, uh, what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is,|sv|4771
A|it's, it's the, uh, ongoing acid rain problem.|sd|4771
A|Especially out in the, uh, uh, Adirondack areas where, you know, the lakes are becoming, uh, changing the acidity of the lakes|sv|4771
A|and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants, uh, or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels, the p H is changing as this acid rain continues to fall.|sd|4771
B|Right.|b|4771
A|And I know that there's been battles over the states up here.|sd|4771
A|Uh, you know, Governor Mario going after, you know, governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix what's going on down there.|sd|4771
A|I remember when I was in Florida,|sd|4771
A|the only problem was that it seemed like it may,|sd|4771
A|it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>.|sd|4771
B|Oh absolutely,|aa|4771
B|yeah,|aa|4771
B|just muggy.|sv|4771
B|So, yes|aa|4771
B|I think,|%|4771
B|yeah,|aa|4771
B|I think you're right.|sv|4771
B|Our most pollute substance down here is just water.|sv|4771
B|But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place.|sv|4771
A|Yeah|b|4771
A|it,|%|4771
B|You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those|sv|4771
B|and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around.|sd|4771
A|Oh, yeah.|b|4771
A|I, you know, I was in Boston once|sd|4771
A|and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee.|sd|4771
A|Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing|sd|4771
B|Absolutely.|aa|4771
A|and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.|sv|4771
A|I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is,|sv|4771
A|I think that's biggest problem|sv|4771
A|because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city.|sv|4771
B|Right.|b|4771
A|And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really.|sd|4771
A|Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help|sv|4771
A|but if you have nowhere to do anything.|sd|4771
B|That's, that's very true.|aa|4771
B|Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere.|sv|4771
B|But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,|sd|4771
B|you've got that,|sd|4771
B|and you got the cars.|sd|4771
B|I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean.|sv|4771
A|Yeah.|b|4771
A|I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami,|sv|4771
A|but I, I, uh, you know,|%|4771
A|Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh,|sd|4771
A|but, you know, up here we have Kodak|sd|4771
B|Right.|b|4771
A|and that's the worst polluter.|sv|4771
A|They put, uh, uh,|%|4771
A|you can smell ether in the air sometimes|sd|4771
A|It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.|sv|4771
B|I guess so.|aa|4771
A|Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras|sd|4771
A|and they, they make film here|sd|4771
A|and they're the worst offender|sv|4771
A|but it's, you know, it's under so much control.|sv|4771
A|You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them|sd|4771
A|but that's really getting under control now.|sv|4771
B|Right.|b|4771
B|I, you know, I don't know in air what they do.|sd|4771
B|Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about.|sd|4771
B|Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh,|%|4771
B|my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas|sd|4771
B|and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there|sd|4771
B|and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air.|sv|4771
B|I, but I don't know how, uh, you know,|sd|4771
B|there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad.|sv|4771
A|Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without,|sv|4771
